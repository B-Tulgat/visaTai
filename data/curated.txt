The following arrangements apply as and from the date of this notice. On 27 October 2009 INIS set out detailed arrangements which would apply in cases of persons who had worked for 5 years or more with work permits and of persons who were made redundant. Those arrangements have now been updated.

This is a consolidated set of arrangements and replaces all previous versions for non-EEA migrant workers (i) who have been employed for 5 or more years with a work permit and (ii) for those who are made redundant. NB: It should be noted that the arrangements set out here reflect the current policy. Immigration policies are kept under on-going review and are subject to change at a future date at the discretion of the Minister. Outline of Policy There are two elements to this policy. In summary these are; 1. Provision for the exemption, subject to conditions from the requirement to hold a work permit of lawfully resident persons who have worked for 5 consecutive years or more with work permits and who currently hold a valid work permit issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. This concession also applies to lawfully resident persons who have worked for 5 consecutive years on the basis of holding a working visa or a work authorisation issued under the Work Authorisation/Working Visa Scheme.* 2. This concession also applies to those persons who held a combination of work permits and spousal/dependant work permits.

The Permits must cover a continuous 5 year period in total and the person must have Stamp 1 endorsements in their passport covering that period of work. *Explanatory Note: Prior to the implementation in 2007 of the Employment Permits Act 2006, a scheme was operated whereby persons were authorised to work in specific sectors of the economy without the need for an employer specific permission. This Scheme was the Work Authorisation/Working Visa Scheme and was in operation from June 2000 to 31 December 2006. The Work Authorisation/Working Visa scheme was evidenced by a sticker in the passport setting out the sector to which employment was restricted. While no new stickers were issued after the scheme expired those already in the system were renewed as required. Individuals who hold a Work Authorisation/Working Visa under the Scheme would hold Immigration Stamp 4 and these would have been renewed on a 2 year basis.

Section 1 Provisions for 5 year workers This part covers: • Persons who have worked for 5 consecutive years or more with work permits (which can now include spousal/dependant permits) and who currently hold a valid work (or spousal/dependant) permit or • Persons who have worked for 5 consecutive years or more and currently hold a Work Authorisation/Working Visa issued under the Work Authorisation/ Working Visa Scheme. The two categories of persons above and who have been working lawfully during that time will be exempted from the requirement to hold a work permit on the next renewal of their immigration registration. This applies equally to those who are still in employment and to those with a work permit who, having completed 5 years work, have since been made redundant. Certain conditions will apply. Eligibility Work Permit Holders To avail of this concession the non-EEA worker must meet the following requirements: The person must have completed 5 consecutive years employment in Ireland with work permits issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.

The non-EEA national should inform their local immigration office of the change in their circumstances without delay. The practical effect will be as follows: Persons with more than 6 months remaining on their immigration permission (as indicated on their Irish Residence Permit (IRP) or GNIB Card) and who have been made redundant will be permitted to continue to reside under their existing Stamp 1 permission for 6 months. Following completion of the 6 month "grace period" the permission will be liable to be terminated unless in the meantime the holder has obtained further employment or has been permitted to remain on another basis. Persons who become redundant with less than 6 months left on their immigration permission (as indicated on their Irish Residence Permit (IRP) or GNIB Card) will be entitled to have your immigration permission (Stamp 1) extended to ensure that you receive the full 6 months grace period. (The issue of a new Irish Residence Permit (IRP) or GNIB Card is subject to the normal fee of €300). (Example:You are made redundant with 2 months still to run on your immigration permission.

In certain cases where a person has been refused registration on Stamp 4 basis due to gaps in their immigration history, or due to the fact that they are no longer economically active, the person may write to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, General Immigration Division, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 to have the details of their case reviewed. Each case will be assessed on its own merits and the Minister's decision is final. Cases will be considered under this arrangement only where the total period of the gaps does not exceed 12 months. No backdating of permissions will be possible. NB: To enable this concession to work efficiently in the interests of migrant workers and the immigration authorities it is necessary to operate simple guidelines and to be able to deal with all cases over the counter. Therefore immigration staff will have no discretion to apply this concession to cases where the gaps in registration exceed those set out above. The immigration authorities will not be in a position to engage in any examination of the reasons for gaps in registration.

It is the responsibility of any non-EEA national to ensure that their registration is kept up to date. Therefore any case that does not meet the eligibility requirements for the concession under Section 1 will fall to be considered under Section 2 and the migrant worker will require a work permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. Qualifying Applicants Persons who satisfy the eligibility criteria for this concession will be issued a Stamp 4 immigration permission for 1 year signifying the right to be present in the State and to be employed without a work permit. Terms and conditions include: • Permissions granted may be renewed annually. • Persons granted the permission are expected to work and to support themselves and any dependents and, if made redundant, the person concerned must seek new employment. • The holder of this permission cannot become an undue burden on the State. • The holder of this permission will be free to work in any employment and will no longer be limited to the current employer.

Again, the determination of eligibility will be on the basis of the stamps in the passport and the immigration authorities cannot enter into any consideration of the reasons for the gaps in registration. Qualifying Applicants Persons in this category already hold Stamp 4 permission. The effect of the concession in these cases is that the restriction as to the sector in which the person can work is removed. This will be signified by the insertion of the words "all sectors" on the work authorisation or working visa. Persons who satisfy the eligibility criteria for this concession will be issued a Stamp 4 immigration permission for 1 year signifying the right to be present in the State and to be employed without a work permit and without restriction to a particular sector. The same terms and conditions as above apply to work authorisation or working visa persons.

Evidence required from applicant: • Your recent work permit and recent payslip. and • You will need a redundancy notice showing that you have been made redundant involuntarily and a P45 form (applies to workers made redundant). and • The person concerned must have immigration permission Stamp 1 (Stamp 4 in the case of Work Authorisation/Working Visa persons) for that 5 year period and be lawfully present in the State. Section 2 Redundancy This part covers: • Those who have been living and working legally in Ireland for less than 5 continuous years on the basis of a work permit (with Immigration Stamp 1) and who have been made redundant. or • Persons with 5 or more years residence but who fail to meet the criteria for section 1. Such persons are now being given a 6 month grace period by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation during which they can seek to find another employer. No labour market needs test is applied in the case of those made redundant. This period will operate from the date of being made redundant involuntarily. Persons who voluntarily quit their employment will not qualify.

In this page “travelling to Ireland” does not mean entry into Ireland (see paragraph 8 for details). 1. What does the Programme do? You may travel to Ireland on your UK Short Stay Visas without the need to obtain a separate Irish Visa where; a. You are not living in the UK (“living in the UK” is having leave to remain in the UK of more than 180 days); and b. You are a National (passport holder) of one of the countries included in the Programme (see paragraph 2); and c. You have an eligible UK short stay visa (see paragraph 3); and d. You have travelled to the UK using this visa; and e.

You have been granted leave to enter the UK or leave to remain in the UK1 (of up to 180 days) using this visa (the leave is granted by a UK immigration official); and f. Your intended visit to Ireland ends before your leave to remain in the UK, under (e), ends. 1 “UK leave” is used in this page to mean “leave to enter the UK or leave to remain in the UK” See paragraph 8 for information about Irish Immigration on arrival. See paragraph 12 for information on holders of diplomatic or special passports issued by one of the countries listed in paragraph 2. As long as you meet all of the above rules, you can travel: • Directly from the UK to Ireland; and • Indirectly from the UK to Ireland. For example: visit the UK, then travel to another country and then to Ireland (without revisiting the UK). 2. What Nationalities are covered? These countries will be referred to as “covered countries” in the rest of this page.

Nationals of the following countries are included in the Programme:  Eastern Europe: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Republic of North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey   South America: Columbia, and Peru   Middle East: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia   Other Asian: India, , Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Peoples Republic of China2, Philippines, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam 2 Nationals of the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau do not require a visa to travel to Ireland. No other Nationals may travel to Ireland using a UK visa. 3. What type of UK visas are covered3? Short stay visit visas granted to people seeking leave to enter or remain in the UK (for up to 180 days) except as: a. A visitor in transit; or b. A visitor for the purpose of marriage or entering into a civil partnership. Entry Clearance granted to people for the purpose of “Visit” or “Business” seeking leave to enter or remain in the UK (for up to 180 days) except as: a. A visitor in transit; or b. A visitor for the purpose of marriage or entering into a civil partnership.

People who are living in the UK long term (more than 180 days) cannot use their UK Biometric Residence Permit or their UK visa to travel to Ireland (see paragraph 13). This includes those who may also have a qualifying short stay visa or Entry Clearance. You can see what a UK visa and Entry Clearance looks like by visiting: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/examples-of-uk-visa-vignettes` Please see paragraph 15 in relation to nationals of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar who hold an Electronic Visa Waiver (EVW) Document issued by the UK. 3 See question (n), towards the bottom of this page, in relation to a possible restriction if you are under 18 years of age. 4. How long will I be able to stay in Ireland under the Programme? The maximum stay in Ireland will be the shorter of: • The end of the period of validity of your UK leave to remain; or • Up to 90 days from your arrival in Ireland.

There are other rules when you travel to Ireland for business. “Rules for working 14 days or less” has more information [link to https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in- ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-less-than-90- days/short-stay-business-visa/#rules ] See paragraph 8 for details on Irish Immigration when you arrive in Ireland. 5. Are there circumstances where I would still need an Irish visa? The need for a visa to visit Ireland is not eliminated in all circumstances by this Programme. Nationals from the covered countries will require an Irish visa for travelling to Ireland unless they qualify under this Programme. What the Programme eliminates, once the rules in paragraph 1 are met, is the need to have an Irish visa when visiting Ireland following a visit to the UK. 6. What rules will a person have to fulfil to use the Programme? You must have landed in and gained lawful entry to the UK, using your current visa, prior to travelling to Ireland. Each distinct period of leave to remain in the UK requires a prior lawful entry by you into the UK before travel to Ireland - no matter what the duration of the UK visa.

Lawful entry to the UK will be shown by the appropriate entry stamp of the UK Border Agency. Therefore, you need an Irish visa if you do not pass through immigration in the UK. There is no minimum length of stay in the UK required before travel to Ireland. Your journey to Ireland must take place within the dates provided by your current UK permission. 7. Can I visit Ireland from the UK more than once during my stay? Yes. You may return to Ireland within the period of validity of the UK leave to remain but will not be able to stay in Ireland for more than 90 days in any one visit. As set out at paragraph 8, the immigration officer at port of entry decides on the length of your stay (if any) in Ireland. 8. What will happen when I arrive in Ireland? Travelling to Ireland does not mean entry into Ireland and entry into Ireland is granted (or refused) by an Irish immigration officer at the port of entry4.

If you are travelling to Ireland under the Programme, you will have to satisfy Irish immigration officers as to the purpose of your visit in the normal way. This Programme does not mean that entry into Ireland will be granted by the Irish immigration officer. If you are granted entry to Ireland then your passport will be stamped by the Irish immigration officer with an entry stamp and a date until which you are allowed to stay in Ireland. More information [link to https://www.irishimmigration.ie/border-management-unit/] 4 If you arrive in Ireland via the border with Northern Ireland, you must report to an Immigration Officer at Burgh Quay, Registration Office, Dublin or local Immigration Office at a Garda Síochána (police) station [link to https://www.irishimmigration.ie/contact- immigration-service-delivery/#immigration-registration ] as soon as possible. 9. What if I want to visit Northern Ireland (or any other part of the UK)?

Subject to the rules set out on this page, the following examples will apply. • If arriving in Northern Ireland and travelling to Ireland, only a UK visa will be required. • If arriving in Northern Ireland, travelling to Ireland and then returning to Northern Ireland, you will not need an Irish visa to travel to Ireland. • If arriving in Ireland and then travelling to Northern Ireland, both an Irish visa and UK visa will be required. • If arriving in Ireland, travelling to Northern Ireland and then returning to Ireland, both an Irish visa and a UK visa will be required. In this example, you can use your UK visa for the return visit to Ireland once you can show the appropriate entry stamp from the UK Border Agency. 10. Can I travel home directly from Ireland? Yes. You may travel out of the Common Travel Area (Ireland and the UK) from Ireland and you must leave Ireland before the expiry of the stamp issued by the immigration officer on your arrival in Ireland. 11.

I am living in a country covered by the Programme (and I am a National of another country not covered by the Programme) can I use the Programme? No. If you are living in a covered country and you are not a National of a covered country, you cannot use the Programme. For example, an Egyptian living in Turkey cannot use the Programme. 12.

Can I use the Programme as a holder of a diplomatic or special passport issued by a covered country? (a) If you hold a diplomatic or special passport and can travel to the UK without a visa, you may travel to Ireland without an Irish visa under the following rules: • If you are posted to the UK, you must have the appropriate “exempt vignette” in your passport from the UK authorities. • If you are not posted to the UK, you must have a UK entry stamp on your passport. (b) If you hold a diplomatic or special passports you can travel to the UK without a visa from the other countries listed in paragraph 2 and not covered in (a): • You can use the Programme in the same way as holders of ordinary passports from your country. 13. I am a National of a covered country and I am living in the UK, can I use the Programme? If you are a National of a covered country and you are living legally long-term (more than 180 days) in the UK, you will need an Irish visa to travel to Ireland.

However, as part of the Programme, you will not have to pay the visa application fee. 14. I am a national of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman or Qatar and have obtained an Electronic Visa Waiver (EVW) document for travel to the UK. Can I avail of the Programme? If you are a National of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, or Qatar you are able to travel to the UK using an Electronic Visa Waiver (EVW) document which you get online. The Programme operates in a modified way if you are one of those nationals and you have an EVW document for the UK (and not a UK visa or UK Entry Preclearance). You may travel to Ireland without an Irish visa if: • You have travelled to the UK using the EVW document; and • You travel directly from the UK to Ireland after using the EVW document to travel to the UK (you cannot travel to Ireland from any other country to Ireland using the EVW document).

If you have an EVW document and wish to use the Programme, then you should have a copy of the EVW document for presentation, on request, at an Irish port of entry. 15. Can I use an Irish visa to go to the UK? This Programme does not allow you, if are required to have a UK visa to travel to the UK, to travel to the UK using an Irish visa. If you wish to enter the UK (including Northern Ireland), you must be in possession of a valid UK visa. The British Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS) is the exception where you can travel to the UK with an Irish visa. BIVS visas are only available to Chinese nationals (who are living in China) and to Indian nationals (who are living in India). More information on BIVS is available at: https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-visit- ireland/british-irish-visa-scheme/ Do I need an Irish Visa? Some examples: Note 1: All of these examples assume that the people in question are Nationals of a covered country (see paragraph 2).

Note 2: These examples do not apply to holders of EVW documents (see paragraph 15). (a) I have an unused UK Visa, but would firstly like to make a trip to Ireland before I go to the UK. I hope to fly into London and then transit (without passing through UK immigration) to Dublin. Do I need an Irish Visa? A – Yes. You will not have entered the UK before arrival in Ireland, only transit it, and you must have a valid Irish Visa. (b) I have an unused UK Visa and would like to go to Ireland first. I am hoping to fly direct to Ireland or via a Schengen/3rd country to get there. Do I need an Irish Visa?A – Yes. You will not have entered the UK before arrival in Ireland and you cannot use the UK visa to travel to Ireland without having used the visa to enter the UK. (c) I spent two weeks in the UK on holidays on my UK Visa and I would like to visit Ireland for one week before returning to India. My visit to Ireland will be within the dates covered by my UK leave.

Do I need to have an Irish Visa? A – No. You have successfully entered the UK and you can use the UK Visa to travel to Ireland. You do not need to apply for an Irish Visa. (d) I visited the UK 2 months ago and returned to my home country. I want to visit Ireland next month and plan to fly directly to Ireland without going to the UK again. My UK leave is still valid for another 3 months. Do I need to have an Irish Visa? A – No. You have previously successfully entered the UK on this visa so you can use this visa to travel to Ireland, either travelling direct to Ireland or transiting a UK/Schengen/3rd country. (e) I am an Indian national with a long-term resident’s visa in the UK and would like to visit Ireland. Do I need a visa to do so? A – Yes. This Programme does not apply to residents of the UK so you must apply for an Irish Visa.

However, as part of the Programme, you will not have to pay the visa application fee. (f) I have spent 150 days in the UK and would like to visit Ireland. Will I get 90 days to stay in Ireland? A – The length of time you get to stay in a country is decided by the Immigration Officer at the port of entry. On the basis of a maximum allowable stay of 90 days in Ireland and a combined total of 180 days within the Irish/UK Common Travel Area, you may be given a maximum of 30 days to stay in Ireland. (g) I am organising a group to travel to a Schengen country first, then the UK and, finally, Ireland. Will my group members need Irish Visas? A – No. They have previously successfully entered the UK on their visas so they can use these visas to travel to Ireland, either travelling direct to Ireland or transiting a UK/Schengen/3rd country. (h) I am a tour operator and would like to bring a group from one of the countries covered by the Programme to Ireland first and then to the UK. They have not been in the UK previously.

Will my group need an Irish Visa? A – Yes. The members of the group who will not have entered the UK before arrival in Ireland cannot use the UK visa to travel to Ireland. (i) I have an expired UK visa which I used to travel to the UK and afterwards made a short trip to Ireland on that visa. I have a new UK visa and would like to visit Ireland first using this visa. Do I need an Irish visa on this occasion? A – Yes. The requirement to have entered the UK applies to each visa issued. So, if you wish to travel to Ireland, you will have to make at enter the UK using the new visa in order to be able to use it to travel to Ireland. If you wish to go to Ireland first, you will have to apply for an Irish visa. (j) I have a UK visitor visa valid for 5 years which I have used 3 months ago and was given 180 UK leave at that time. I left the UK after 2 weeks. I have since been granted residency in the UK.

Can I use my UK visitor visa to travel to Ireland? A - No. Once you were granted a visa to live in the UK (under any circumstances) you will not qualify for the Programme and you will have to apply for an Irish visa to travel to Ireland. (k) I spent two weeks in the UK on holidays using my UK Visa. I returned to my home country and my UK leave now has 10 days left. Do I need to have an Irish Visa? A - No. Bear in mind that the length of time you get to stay in Ireland is decided by the Immigration Officer at the port of entry. The maximum allowable stay in Ireland would be the lower of • 90 days, or • The time remaining on your UK leave. In this instance, the maximum stay in Ireland would be 10 days. (l) I spent two weeks in the UK on holidays using my UK Visa. I returned to my home country and my UK leave has ended. My UK visa is a multi-entry visa and is valid for another 2 years. Do I need to have an Irish Visa? A - Yes.

I returned to my home country and my UK leave has ended. My UK visa is a multi-entry visa which is valid for another 2 years. I hope to fly into London and then transit (without passing through UK immigration) to Dublin. Do I need an Irish Visa? A – Yes. As you are not proposing to enter the UK, only transit it, and your UK leave has ended you must have a valid Irish Visa. (p) I do not need a visa to go to the UK and plan to travel to Ireland from the UK. Do I need an Irish Visa? A – Yes. As you do not have a UK visa (including where the UK changes its visa rules) you do not qualify for the Programme. . === ./immigration_rules/ireland-immigration/wp_content/uploads/2023/09/Student_Application_Form_Sep_23.txt === 403 Forbidden nginx === ./immigration_rules/ireland-immigration/wp_content/uploads/2023/06/Visa_Waiver_for_non_EEA_and_EU_School_Students_v2.txt === LIST OF TRAVELLERS For school trips within the European Union Name of school: Address of school: Purpose and length of trip: Name(s) of accompanying teacher(s): The accuracy of the data given is confirmed.

The ILEP is available here and includes details of programmes meeting specified criteria. The inclusion of programmes in the ILEP enables providers to recruit non-EEA students to study full-time in Ireland. The types of programmes included in the ILEP are set out in Section 2. Since 2019, foundation programmes meeting specific criteria have been eligible for inclusion.

The information contained in the student handbook must be up-to-date and relevant to the Irish context. 5. Providers must have a “teacher handbook” or equivalent document, which is available to teachers with information on their responsibilities and duties, including a code of conduct and disciplinary measures to be taken by the provider. Section 5C Student Services 1. Providers must provide assistance and support to students on immigration-related issues. An employee(s) who does not require immigration permission must be available to students in this regard. Administrative positions in any management role responsible for non-EEA students, and / or positions with responsibility for attendance records and the attendance system must not be filled by non-EEA students. A non-EEA student enrolled in a programme of study should not have an employment role within the same provider in view of a potential conflict of interest. 2. Providers must be compliant with Section 67 of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012. In so doing, providers must make information on relevant external accreditations and awarding bodies available to students. Where memberships of professional bodies are also listed in public materials, the relationship of these to the programme(s) must be made clear. 3.

Section 2: Programme Requirements Please note: these requirements are without prejudice to any additional requirements or measures that may be imposed by Irish immigration authorities or Irish Government Departments. Programmes included in the ILEP are divided into the following categories: (a) Higher education programmes leading to major Awards; (b) Higher education programmes leading to non-major awards; (c) Professional awards; (d) English language programmes; and (e) Foundation programmes. The criteria for categories (a), (b) and (c) and (e) are published on the ISD website. The criteria and requirements for English language programmes are set out in this document.

Definition and Interpretation English language programmes which are eligible for inclusion in the ILEP must have the following characteristics: a) Be a minimum of 25 weeks in duration and offered within a seven month period3 with a minimum of 15 classroom tuition hours per week, excluding breaks, delivered Monday to Friday between the hours of 9am and 5pm; b) Have a defined learning pathway (i.e. a course programme), with specified learning outcomes stating the learning goals to be achieved at the end of the programme; c) Have an assessment framework aligned to the programme and its learning outcomes; d) Be subject to internal quality assurance; and e) Be offered exclusively to students who are speakers of other languages, for whom English is not their first language, and conclude in one of the English language proficiency exams (with a specified score / grade where the exam is a system) listed in Table 1 (completed at an approved test centre); or 3 Immigration permission of up to eight months may be granted to students, to accommodate four weeks’ holidays and allow time to sit the end-of-programme exam. 4 f) Lead to a recognised English Language Teaching (ELT) award made by a recognised national or international awarding body.

Each programme is considered on its own merits. The Department of Justice may liaise with regulatory authorities, awarding bodies and external quality assurance agencies as appropriate to confirm that individual programmes meet the specified programme criteria. Where deemed appropriate, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the Minister, will seek advice from Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) where education- related queries arise. The following criteria apply for English language programmes listed in the ILEP:  The provider must have the capacity, resources and expertise (including qualifications and experience of staff) to deliver its programmes.  The immigration and academic track record and pass rates on the programme must be to the satisfaction of the Department of Justice.  The examining body must remain in good standing with the regulatory authorities, including immigration authorities, in its home jurisdiction.

In this regard, the Department of Justice may liaise with such authorities to confirm the awarding body’s current standing.  All relevant records setting out the relationship between the examining body and the Irish provider, together with the terms and conditions applicable to the provision of programmes, must be provided on request to the Department of Justice.  Programmes listed in the ILEP must demonstrate progression of at least one full CEFRL level during the course of the 25-week programme.  Providers must ensure programmes are listed in the published ILEP in advance of marketing to, or recruiting, non-EEA students.  Information provided to the immigration authorities will be shared as necessary with DFHERIS and members of the ILEP Committees. Please note: English language programmes with a specific professional or occupational domain focus, e.g. IT or tourism, will typically contain a module or strand of the overall English programme focusing on a specific lexis or subject- area. Such programmes must culminate in a minimum B1 or equivalent grade, as formally calibrated by the exam provider should the programme not culminate in an award. English for Business programmes will have learning outcomes within the relevant language systems and language skills descriptions.

Programmes will culminate in a relevant exam identified as assessing English for business purposes.

Such programmes must culminate in a minimum B1 or equivalent grade, as formally calibrated by the exam provider should the programme not culminate in an award. 5 Table 1: English language proficiency exams: end-of-course exams with minimum scores/grades Examining Body4 Exam Title Minimum Exit Score5 Interactive English Language Tests Ltd (IELT) Test of Interactive English (TIE) A2 English Test for Academic & Professional Purposes (ETAPP) B1 British Council/ IDP IELTS / Cambridge University Press & Assessment (CUPA) International English Language Testing System (IELTS) (Academic) 4.0/ B1 International English Language Testing System (IELTS) (General Training) 4.0/ B1 Cambridge University Press & Assessment (CUPA) Key Test (also known as Cambridge English: Key - KET) Pass C/A2 B1 Preliminary (also known as Cambridge English: Preliminary – PET) Pass C/B1 B2 First (also known as Cambridge English: First - FCE) Pass C/B2 C1 Advanced (also known as Cambridge English: Advanced – CAE) Pass C/C1 C2 Proficiency (also known as Cambridge English: Proficiency – CPE) Pass C/C1+ -C2 Occupational English Test (OET) Pass C/B2 Pearson Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic) 43/ B1 Trinity College London Integrated Skills Exam (ISE) A2 Integrated Skills in English (ISE) Foundation (F) ISE F Pass /A2 Integrated Skills Exam (ISE) I ISE I Pass /B1 Integrated Skills Exam (ISE) II ISE II Pass /B2 Integrated Skills Exam (ISE) III ISE III Pass /C1 Integrated Skills Exam (ISE) IV ISE IV Pass/C2 ETS TOEFL iBT 42 / B1 72/ B2 Oxford University Press Oxford Test of English A2-B2 A2-B2 Oxford Test of English Advanced B2-C1 B2 Language Cert LanguageCert International ESOL (four skills tests only) A2 Access B1 Achiever B2 Communicator C1 Expert C2 Mastery LanguageCert Academic A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 B1 4 All exams must be completed in-person at an approved test centre/location authorised by the Examining Body. 5 A programme must prepare a student to exit with language competence of at least the minimum exit score or above. 6 Duration and attendance requirements Duration and attendance requirements for English Language Programmes listed in the ILEP: 1.

Programme attendance requirements include the following: a) Non-EEA students must be attending the programme on a full-time, daytime basis, which is defined as students attending between the hours of 9am and 5pm on a minimum of four days between Monday and Friday each week. b) Programmes must be delivered fully through in-person classes to best meet the pedagogical needs of students and optimum student experience6. c) Formal timetabled hours for student contact must amount to at least 15 hours (15 x 60 minutes) per week, excluding breaks. d) The programme must operate for a minimum of 25 weeks over a 7-month period; and the tuition element must constitute at least 375 hours during that period. 2. The hours of tuition must be appropriate in terms of the aims, objectives and learning outcomes set for the programme to enable the student to successfully achieve the minimum exit score / grade for the end-of-programme exam. Modifying tuition hours for the purposes of meeting the minimum duration criteria for the ILEP is not acceptable. 3. A provider must display the detailed timetables (in calendar format) for all its programmes on its website in a manner freely accessible to the public. 4.

On enrolment, the provider must give each student a written timetable clearly identifying the daily and weekly tuition times with dates. The programme schedule, including holiday periods, must be presented by the student to the Immigration Officer for inspection during the student’s registration. a) Holiday periods must be outlined in advance. b) Calculation of a student’s programme end date must take into account bank holidays and holiday closures to ensure a minimum of 375 tuition hours. c) The programme timetable must be set out in such a way that holiday periods cannot at any point exceed 1/3 of the total weeks elapsed (front loading of holidays will not be permitted). d) The tuition weeks should not exceed 7 months to allow time to sit the end-of-programme exam. e) It is the responsibility of providers to provide students with tuition as stated in this timetable. Any changes to the timetable must be with the agreement of the student. 5. Attendance by students is defined as attending the full designated tuition hours - i.e. arriving more than 15 minutes late, or leaving before the class has concluded, means the student is marked absent for the class / class segments.

Providing this leeway should not be adopted by providers as a mechanism for allowing students to regularly arrive late without being marked absent. The design and operation of the system for recording attendance must be in line with ILEP requirements, whether manual, electronic or a mix. Attendance must be recorded in each class and class teachers must also record the overall number of students in attendance. Manual attendance sheets must be retained by the provider for a minimum of 12 months for inspection and will be checked against any computer records. ISD also reserves the rights to request data on monitoring of students’ attendance. Publishing information for students Providers should not market programmes to non-EEA nationals or recruit them to programmes in advance of achieving a programme listing in the published ILEP. Programmes must be clearly described in published material and in communications with potential students. Information should accurately describe the programme content and the aims/outcomes on completion.

In addition, the provider will be required to provide information regarding the status of all international students associated with the relevant programme(s).  Completion by a student of the foundation programme(s) offered by the provider can no longer be linked to a conditional offer of an undergraduate (NFQ Level 8) or postgraduate (NFQ Level 9 or 10) award of a recognised Irish higher education awarding body: If the foundation programme provider can no longer demonstrate a link with Irish higher education provider(s) providing conditional offers to 21 Other circumstances may arise outside of those listed above which warrant the removal of a provider and / or its programmes from the ILEP. 14 students, the programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Providers found to have made false, misleading or incomplete declarations in support of an application will be prohibited from having programmes included in the ILEP: The provider and all of its programme(s), will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days, unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Providers found to have failed to notify ISD of changes since its previous application was submitted: Where such changes arise, the provider must inform the Department of Justice immediately, and no later than 5 working days.

This statement must: i. list all persons who are owners9, beneficial owners*, directors, shareholders and/or investors in the provider, or holding company of which the provider is a subsidiary, including shadow directors or persons otherwise having a beneficial ownership of the provider company / legal entity. ii. set out shareholding arrangements and confirm that all shares held by persons listed as a shareholder, or director of a provider are in the name of the persons listed and are entirely at their disposal.

Where shares are held in trust this must be so stated, detailing for whom they are held in trust; iii. provide a declaration as to whether any individuals who hold an interest in the school also act as a recruitment agent, and iv. declare all other shareholdings, directorships or interest(s) held by the listed shareholders and directors in other education and training providers in Ireland and in any other jurisdiction. *For the purposes of this criterion a “beneficial owner” is an individual who benefits from at least 25 per cent of the business, (i.e. the provider), where this has been established, i.e.: i. if the individuals who benefit from the business have been determined, any individual who benefits from at least 25 per cent of the business ii. if the individuals who benefits from the business have yet to be determined, the class of such individuals in whose main interest the business is set up or operates, and iii. any individual who exercises control of at least 25 per cent of the business.

NB: Any individual who is the beneficial owner of a body corporate that benefits from or exercises control over the business is taken to benefit from or exercise control over the business. Failing to make a full and accurate disclosure, or making a false or misleading disclosure, may result in the provider and its programmes being removed from the ILEP. Providers who make false, misleading or incomplete declarations will be prohibited from having programmes included in the ILEP and /or its successor. Providers are obliged to ensure that the information submitted to ISD remains up-to-date and are therefore required to communicate any changes of ownership to ISD within 5 working days of such changes taking place. Failure to do so will result in programmes being removed from the ILEP unless a successful appeal is lodged.

Failure to do so will result in programmes being removed from the ILEP unless a successful appeal is lodged. 7 Designated awarding bodies, institutes of technology, technological universities and other bodies granted statutory power to make awards under Irish law. 8 The Affidavit must be completed in the presence of a person authorised by law to administer oaths, e.g. a Solicitor or Commissioner for Oaths. 9 For the purpose of these criteria, owners are defined here as anyone who has a financial investment or interest in the legal entity. An owner may be active or not active in the business, sole, part or co-owner, beneficial owner, shareholder, any person for whom shares are held in trust by another person etc. 10 Information on individuals who hold an interest in a provider and also act as a recruitment agent must be set out in the statement of ownership. 8 Section 4: Requirements of Providers11 1. All owners, shareholders, directors and managers of the provider must have a sound track record in educational provision and with immigration compliance nationally and in any other jurisdiction. Managers include individuals employed as “Director of Studies”. 2.

The immigration authorities must be fully satisfied in relation to the continued capacity of the provider to address all aspects of the provision of foundation programmes to students. In respect of student data to be provided to ISD for immigration purposes, the relevant data protection permissions should be agreed with students accordingly and in line with GDPR requirements15. ISD and the Department of Justice do not require the provision of biometric data. 8. The owners, shareholders, directors and managers must meet all other national legal requirements, e.g. employment regulations. The owners, shareholders, directors and managers must also satisfy all immigration requirements. 9. The provider must be tax compliant and remain in good financial standing;16 10.

Such records should be available for inspection by / submission to ISD. c. absenteeism and expulsion: There must be a clear system in place for the recording of student absences, for which any procedures should describe the steps which are taken and by whom in the case of an absent student.

This system should identify the person(s) responsible for recording absences, their contact information, and any associated procedure as to how a student can have an absence recorded as a medical appointment or some other qualification of the circumstances pertaining to the absence, i.e. in the context of disciplinary action arising. It must be clear at which point in this procedure that steps for expulsion of the student are activated and by whom, with a clear description of the actions and requirements at each stage in the warning system. All standard correspondence as part of this process must be retained and be available to relevant internal personnel and external authorities on request. Absenteeism and expulsion procedures must be implemented in a timely manner, i.e. the disciplinary action must follow immediately after the absenteeism issue has been identified by management. It is not acceptable that non-EEA students are expelled towards the end of their programmes in relation to issues identified at an earlier point in the programme. The disciplinary system which may ultimately lead to expulsion must be clearly laid out in writing, including the issue of forfeiture of fees.

The only exception to this can be in the case of a serious incident, for example where the student has engaged in violent conduct against staff or students. The student should have recourse to some form of appeal or review and this process should be set out clearly and recorded. d. student sick leave: There must be a procedure for contacting the designated person(s) responsible in the provider on the first day of sickness and each day subsequently, together with the instructions relating to submission of a doctor’s certificate(s). The procedure regarding absenteeism and expulsion must be communicated to, and understood by, students including reference to requirements in relation to uncertified sick leave beyond the statutory entitlement. e. holidays and breaks: No unscheduled breaks will be permissible except in documented cases of illness or close family bereavement.

The student will sign the agreement stating that they understand the exam is mandatory and agree to sit the exam. The document must be available for inspection in respect of each student; iii. documentary evidence of entering students for the required exams.

The relevant data protection permissions should be agreed with students accordingly and in line with GDPR requirements. g. complaints and grievances: The following must be documented: i. clear information describing what constitutes a complaint or grievance by a student; ii. the procedure to be followed by the provider in the event of receipt of a complaint / grievance; iii. the name and contact details of the person(s) responsible for managing this procedure; iv. the maximum duration from receipt of a complaint to resolution of the issue; v. the means of appeal open to students should a claim not be resolved to their satisfaction. 13.

Payment should be documented and a receipt provided to the student, whether the student is paying in advance for a first programme/year or based in the State and renewing their student immigration permission. Please note: Providers must adhere to the policies advised to students; published and articulated in documents submitted to ISD. Failure to demonstrate that policies are being implemented to the satisfaction of ISD may result in programmes being removed from the ILEP.

This must include: a. details of all agents with which a recruitment arrangement has been agreed; and b. information on fees and all other ancillary charges associated with the delivery of the programme to ensure prospective students are made aware of all costs associated with the programme prior to enrolment. 4. Providers must provide students with clear information on health insurance requirements. The cost and extent of the insurance must be clear. Where a student pays for health insurance through the provider, documented evidence of payment and cover from the insurance company must be supplied by the provider to the student. 5. Providers17 must have arrangements in place for the protection of all students on ILEP programmes in the event that a programme ceases prematurely i.e. financial bonding arrangements for a student to have their unspent fees and related costs reimbursed as part of an insurance policy, or academic bonding where the student completes the programme with another provider(s). Learner protection arrangements must cover the period from when a student enrols on a programme and pays the relevant fees until the time the student has completed the programme and the end-of-programme exams.

The arrangements must reflect cover of the maximum student numbers with at least two other providers i.e. a provider with a maximum capacity of 100 students must have coverage of at least 100 students at each of the other two providers included in the bonding agreement. If the bonding arrangement is with four or more other providers, each proportion of the maximum capacity must be covered by two providers. The arrangements for cover must be clearly set out, including possibilities of teaching out students in their current location. Where an alteration or suspension of an existing academic bonding agreement will affect another provider(s), they must be notified in advance. c. Providers participating in the statutory Learner Protection Fund must demonstrate compliance with QQI’s arrangements for the Protection of Enrolled Learners (PEL). All students must be protected, with no gap in cover. Evidence of the learner protection arrangements in place must be provided to ISD on request. Such evidence must comprise statements from the relevant financial body(ies) in the case of insurance arrangements; letters of confirmation from awarding bodies and/or alternate providers in the context of academic bonding arrangements; or confirmation of compliance with QQI’s arrangements for PEL.

For handling of advance fee payments dependent on the visa application process, providers18 must operate an escrow/delayed payment account with a payments institution authorised by a designated competent authority under Directive (EU) 2015/236619 or a separate client visa/escrow account with a financial body regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. The operation of the account must be in accordance with the following key steps:  students pay programme fees in advance of making a visa application;  Funds must remain in this account until the student’s visa application is determined: a. If the student confirms the successful visa application, the funds are released to the provider’s current account; or b. If the visa application is refused, the funds (less any pre-indicated handling charge) must be refunded within 20 working days of the decision being communicated to the provider. Evidence of arrangements to satisfy this requirement, statements from the relevant financial body(ies) and statements/reconciliation reports in relation to the account must be available for inspection and/or provided to ISD on request. Failure to comply with this criterion will result in the provider being removed from the ILEP unless a successful appeal is lodged. 7.

Evidence of arrangements to satisfy this requirement, statements from the relevant financial body(ies) and statements/reconciliation reports in relation to the account must be available for inspection and/or provided to ISD on request. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in the provider being removed from the ILEP unless a successful appeal is lodged. Section 5B Teaching and Learning 1. Providers must enrol no more than 15 students per class, i.e. each student is enrolled for the duration of the programme and registered for a specific class. No more than 15 students should either be listed in the class attendance list or physically present in a class. Students cannot change programmes, or attend any classes other than the one for which they are registered for the duration of the programme. 17 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015, articles 11(4) and 100 refer to competent authorities. 12 2. Providers must have mandatory attendance requirements of a minimum 85% attendance for all enrolled students. The system of taking and recording attendance must be documented and publicly available.

Where a student has 25% or more uncertified absence in the first six weeks of their programme, this must be communicated to ISD. This communication must also set out the provider’s attendance policy being applied in this instance, i.e. what measures are or have been taken to address non-attendance. Where a student cannot make up attendance to a minimum of 85% before the programme ends, the student must be informed that they do not meet the attendance requirements and this fact will be communicated to ISD. There is no mechanism permitted whereby students can make up an uncertified absence(s) through additional classes, either during or after the end of the programme. 3. Providers must have documentation which clearly states the number of classroom tuition hours, i.e. a minimum of 15x60 minutes per week. This tuition time minimum does not include breaks. The minimum programme duration is 375 tuition hours, delivered over at least 25 weeks. 4. Providers must have a “student handbook” or equivalent document, which is available to students with information on the programme, its operation and obligations on the part of the student.

Providers19 must operate an escrow/delayed payment account with a payments institution authorised by a designated competent authority under Directive (EU) 2015/2366 or a separate client visa/escrow account with a financial body regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland for receipt of advance fee payments dependent on the visa process. Statements and reconciliation reports in relation to this account must be maintained, available for inspection and provided to ISD on request. 7. Providers must provide students with pastoral care, advice and assistance, e.g. on immigration-related issues; with finding accommodation; opening a bank account; gaining access to medical services etc. 18 Requirements set out in full in Section 5A- Protections for students. 19 Requirements set out in full in Section 5A- Protections for students. 13 8.

Providers must accurately represent their facilities in all marketing and promotional materials. Misrepresentation of facilities may result in a provider being removed from the ILEP. Section 5E Student Profile 1. Providers must have clear, documented admissions criteria for programmes which enable a student to successfully engage with the programme, e.g. a placement test which is fit-for-purpose. 2. Providers must register students for the relevant end-of-programme exam(s) and retain records of exam registration and results for a three-year period. Evidence of registration of students for exams must be supplied to ISD on request. Failure to register students for end-of-programme exams may result in a provider being removed from the ILEP. Providers must ensure students are aware of their obligations to sit the end-of-programme exam and that evidence will be required by immigration officers at renewal. The letter of completion provided to the student must include the details of the end of programme exam. 3. Providers must seek to ensure a good linguistic mix in the class, i.e. a multi-cultural classroom and students with a variety of mother tongues, and provide a student profile to facilitate language learning opportunities as evidenced in the business plan and in the current enrolments. 4.

PLEASE NOTE: Any other information required regarding the programme(s) submitted by the provider, the award(s) to which they lead, the awarding body, or the provider may be sought by the Department of Justice from the provider and / or the awarding body as appropriate. This information will inform the decision-making process regarding the inclusion of programmes in the ILEP. Providers must immediately inform, and not later than 5 working days, ISD in the Department of Justice of any changes since its previous ILEP application, including, inter alia, changes to ownership, shareholdings, directorships, governance, any changes to its status or operations, (including learner protection or client visa arrangements), staffing arrangements or location(s) of provision. Failure to do so, or the provision of false or misleading information, will result in the immediate removal of all programmes of the provider from the ILEP unless a successful appeal is lodged. Additional documentation must be supplied in respect of changes to records previously supplied and on the request of ISD. The Department of Justice and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), reserve the right to seek information, at any time, on programmes included in the ILEP, their provision and the awards to which they lead.

The ILEP Committee meet in advance of each ILEP update, although extraordinary meetings may also be held as required. Where an application has been approved in full, the provider will receive an email confirming this and notified that students cannot be recruited to programme(s) until the ILEP update is published on the specified date. Until such time as the programmes appear in the ILEP, visa / student immigration permission applications will be refused. As soon as the updated ILEP is published, the provider should check that the information contained in its listings are accurate. A programme listing in the ILEP will only be valid until the date of cessation of the ILEP. In the case of unsuccessful applications / applications where some of the programmes were refused, email correspondence will issue and the applicant will be provided with an opportunity to appeal the decision of the ILEP Committee by lodging an appeal application by email within 5 working days of the decision being communicated. Applications may be refused or awarded provisional status by the ILEP Committee and either decision may be appealed. [Provisional status means that programmes will be listed in the ILEP until the next update.

When conducting an inspection the following are (non-exhaustive) examples of the type of information sought as part of monitoring activities and during on-site inspections:  Provider and ownership / management details including CRO information; revenue number; tax clearance certificate; names of directors and principal; and connections with other providers(including shared directorships).  Provider capacity details including inter alia: o Number of students (EEA and non-EEA) in previous academic year or 12 month period and completion rates per programme / award; o Number of intended intakes and enrolment dates for next 12 month period for each programme the provider is seeking to include or has included in the ILEP; o Number of programmes and award type(s);  Lease details, evidence of relevant planning permission and fire safety certification;  Samples of student enrolment letters and induction materials;  Documentation pertaining to learner protection arrangements;  Statements and reconciliation reports relating to the client visa account or international payments holding service operated by the provider for the purpose of holding course fees;  Records of attendance monitoring and details of warnings and expulsions;  Evidence of progression of students in line with conditional offers on completion of the foundation programme;  Records of the handling of refund requests and complaints and grievances;  Documented policies and procedures in place.

From that time, only providers with authorisation to use the IEM will be permitted to recruit non-EEA nationals to full-time programmes which meet immigration requirements.  Significant failures identified by QQI: Where significant failings of relevance to ISD and ILEP are identified during a provider’s engagement with QQI, including through an application for the IEM, this information will be shared with ISD, and the provider and all of its programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Where significant failings are identified which affect the ability of the provider to trade, deliver courses to students, comply with student protection requirements and/or meet academic standards, the provider and all of its programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Provider has ceased trading: All details regarding a provider that has ceased trading will be removed from the ILEP within 5 working days.  Provider is no longer offering a programme(s): If a provider has decided not to offer a given programme(s), it must inform the Department of Justice immediately, and no later than 5 working days.

Failure to do so will result in removal from the ILEP after 5 working days, unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Provider is shown to have made false or misleading statements in its marketing, advertising or promotional material regarding its status / recognition or the status / recognition of its programmes with regard to the ILEP, the TrustEd mark, or the bodies responsible: The provider and all of its programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Provider is shown to have made false or misleading statements in its marketing, advertising or promotional material: The provider and all of its programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Provider allows the use of false information or misrepresentation of facilities, immigration requirements, costs and accommodation in marketing, advertising or promoting courses to students, either in published materials or by agents: The provider and all of its programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Provider is no longer tax compliant: Where a provider cannot produce a current tax clearance certificate valid for a 12-period on request, it will normally be deemed to no longer meet the criteria for continued inclusion in the ILEP and will be removed after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Provider failed to demonstrate compliance with the ILEP criteria during the course of an inspection, investigation or monitoring activity: If a provider fails to demonstrate compliance with any element of the ILEP criteria, the provider and all of its programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.  Provider has failed to demonstrate eligibility to move from a provisional to full listing: If a provider fails to demonstrate that it has adequately addressed the issues leading to it being designated a provisional listing, the provider and all if its programme(s) will be removed from the ILEP after 5 working days unless a successful appeal is lodged.

Where a breach of the criteria and requirements has been identified, information will be shared with DFHERIS and members of the ILEP and/or Appeals Committee. Providers will be given 5 working days notification of the intention to remove a programme(s) from the ILEP. Providers may appeal the decision to remove within this 5 working day period by lodging an appeal application. The appeal application will be examined by senior officials of the two Departments who will review the initial decision to remove the programmes and consider any additional information provided in the appeal application. Any applications / additional documents received after the 5 working day window for lodging such documents has passed cannot be considered and ISD will proceed with removal of programmes. The Department of Justice and the GNIB reserve the right to remove a provider and its programme(s) from the ILEP at any time on immigration grounds, once 5 working days’ notice has been served and in circumstances where an appeal is lodged, the Appeal Committee upholds the original decision.

In addition to the above bases for removal of programme(s) from the ILEP, certain, or all, programmes of a provider(s) may be subject to an immediate temporary suspension of issuance of visa / student immigration permission for non-EEA students pending the outcome of investigation by the Department of Justice or GNIB. Such suspension may occur in the event of the following, inter alia:  notification from QQI of significant and serious failings of the provider;  allegations or concerns regarding serious breaches of immigration rules;  where the stated policies of the provider are not being adhered to, e.g. in the case of attendance monitoring and expulsion or the issuing of refunds;  serious disruption to provision on which non-EEA students are enrolled, i.e. more than two consecutive days of classes not being provided. In such cases the provider must notify ISD in the Department of Justice and confirm plans for the resumption of classes.

Such plans must also be communicated to enrolled students;  serious concern regarding the ability of the provider to continue trading, e.g. non-payment of staff; non-provision of refunds to students within the specified timeframe;  where accreditation by an awarding body has been suspended and / or where a provider is subject to sanctions by an awarding body and / or where the awarding body is subject to sanctions by the relevant external quality assurance body;  where it becomes clear from examination data that students are being accepted on to programmes for which they are not academically prepared, or where they lack the language competency to complete their programme;  where the provider fails to co-operate with immigration authorities, including refusing to co-operate with an unannounced inspection;  failure to report in a timely manner incident(s) of student(s) failure to engage with programme(s), [i.e. sustained failure to complete course work, attend classes or sit exams]; and  failure by the provider to comply with the terms of their agreement with the relevant awarding body(ies).

Where changes to a programme result in the programme no longer meeting programme and/or delivery requirements, non-EEA students should not be recruited and the provider must contact ISD to ensure the programme is removed from the list. Where a provider has programmes listed in the ILEP and remains in compliance with ILEP criteria, it may continue to recruit non-EEA nationals until the ILEP ceases operation. In April 2025 there will be one final opportunity for listed providers to apply for the inclusion of additional programmes in the ILEP. The final ILEP 1 This built on a previous government decision announced by the Ministers for Education and Justice: Regulatory Reform of the International Education Sector 2 The members of the European Economic Area: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. These arrangements/regulations apply to programmes for students who are citizens from countries other than those listed above or Switzerland. 3 update will be published in June 2025, after which point there will be no further additions to the list.

Definition and interpretation A foundation programme is defined as a programme which provides “the formation necessary to enable an international student meet the minimum academic requirements (all other things being equal) for participation in a higher education programme in an Irish higher education institution and to cope with living and studying in Ireland”.3 For the purpose of inclusion in the ILEP, it must be one of the following foundation qualifications: 3 QQI Awards Standards for Pre-Higher Education Foundation Awards For International Students 4 a) QQI-validated Preparation for Undergraduate Programme, leading to NFQ4 Level 5 Special Purpose Award b) QQI-validated Preparation for Postgraduate Programme, leading to NFQ Level 8 Special Purpose Award c) Equivalent awards that are included in the NFQ and validated by an Irish awarding body5 Programmes must be fully validated at the time of the ILEP application. Subject to the criteria set out in Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this document being met, a foundation programme, (as defined in a, b, or c above), is eligible for inclusion in the ILEP if the programme is accompanied by a conditional offer from an Irish higher education provider.

The higher education provider must offer either undergraduate (NFQ Level 8) or postgraduate (NFQ Level 9 or 10) awards validated by one of the following Irish awarding bodies: o QQI o an institute of technology with delegated authority to make awards o a university6 or technological university7 in the State o National University of Ireland o Other bodies that have been granted the statutory power to make awards under Irish law8 Where a provider offers both foundation and higher education programmes, it must confirm that it retains the places on conditional offer until the student has completed their foundation programme. It must also specify the higher education programme associated with the conditional offer. In circumstances where a foundation programme provider does not offer higher education programmes, it must submit a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between it and the provider(s) offering higher education programme(s) for which students are being prepared. The MoU must confirm that each student is provided with a conditional offer to a specified higher education programme.

Duration, volume and attendance requirements Any programme included in the ILEP as satisfying the foundation programmes category must have a duration of at least 25 weeks with at least 15 hours classroom tuition each week, excluding breaks. Non-EEA students must attend the programme on a full-time, daytime basis, which is defined as students attending between the hours of 9am and 5pm on at least four days between Monday and Friday each week. Programmes must be delivered fully through in-person classes to best meet the pedagogical needs of students and optimum student experience, except where a move to blended or wholly online delivery is in response to Government advice or public health restrictions. The programme must be structured and offered in a fashion which allows the student to progress to the higher education programme in advance of seeking renewal of their student immigration permission. Publishing information for students Providers should not market programmes to students or recruit students to programmes in advance of achieving a programme listing in the published ILEP. Programmes must be clearly described in published material and in communications with potential students. Information should accurately describe the programme content and the aims/outcomes on completion.

Students should be informed as to the level of programme, progression paths and immigration requirements. Section 3: Providers listed in the ILEP A foundation programme, as defined in Section 2, is eligible for inclusion in the ILEP when it satisfies the 4 National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) 5 Bodies that have been granted the statutory power to make awards under Irish law. 6 Dublin City University; University of Galway; Maynooth University; Trinity College Dublin; University College Cork; University College Dublin; University of Limerick and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). 7 These are established pursuant to the provisions of Part 2 of the Technological Universities Act 2018. 8 For the purposes of inclusion in the ILEP, King’s Inns is considered to be an awarding body. 5 programme criteria set out in Section 2, and is offered by a provider with programmes currently listed in the ILEP. The ILEP is closed to new providers.

Providers* with programmes listed in the ILEP must comply with all conditions and requirements set out in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this document in order to retain a listing in the ILEP. *Recognised Irish awarding bodies9 must comply with the Programme Requirements in Section 2 and the ‘Other Conditions’ set out in Section 5 of this document. Provider Ownership Where there are changes to the arrangements previously advised to ISD, a revised statement of ownership of the legal entity, signed on affidavit10 by an owner of the company/ legal entity, must be submitted.

The programme must be fully validated at the time of application. Duration, volume and attendance requirements Programmes in the Higher Education Programmes leading to Major Awards category in the ILEP, must have an associated workload of at least 60 ECTS (or equivalent) credits per academic year and be at least one full-time academic year in duration. Non-EEA students must attend the programme on a full-time, daytime, face-to-face basis, which is defined as students attending between the hours of 8am and 6pm on at least three days between Monday and Friday each week. Programme delivery must be predominantly through in-person classes to provide a high quality educational experience for students coming to Ireland, with the exception of instances where Government advice or public health restrictions require a move to wholly online delivery. Internships/Placements Students enrolled on courses leading to major awards at Level 7 or above on the NFQ may undertake an internship/placement where this forms an integral part of an academic course listed in the ILEP, or an eligible programme offered by a provider with authorisation to use the TrustEd mark.

It is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that the placements are appropriate to the nature and level of the academic programme and do not exceed 50% of the total duration of the course. Completion of the placement(s) must count for ECTS credits and contribute to the final award achieved. Providers should assist students in finding placements and, where requested, provide a letter of confirmation to the student/employer indicating that the placement forms an integral part of a programme and does not affect the terms and conditions of the student’s Stamp 2 permission. Students on a Stamp 2 immigration permission may work more than 20 hours per week in these placements/internships. Students cannot be self-employed as part of the placement and working hours and conditions must be in accordance with all applicable regulations. The provider should also ensure the international students’ support or welfare needs are addressed for the duration of the placement. (b) Higher Education Programmes leading to Non-major Awards Definition and interpretation A Higher Education Programme leading to a Non-major Award is defined as a programme at NFQ level 6 or above, which leads to a non-major award made by a recognised national higher education awarding body.

Non-EEA students must be attending the programme on a full-time, daytime face-to-face basis, which is defined as students attending between the hours of 8am and 6pm on at least three days between Monday and Friday each week. Programmes delivery must be predominantly through in-person classes to provide a high quality educational experience for students coming to Ireland, with the exception of instances where Government advice or public health restrictions require a move to wholly online delivery. (c) Professional Awards Definition and interpretation Providers who have been awarded ‘platinum status’ by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) are eligible to apply for the inclusion of their ACCA examination preparatory programmes in the ILEP. This is in accordance with the Reform of the International Education Sector and Student Immigration System (Government Policy Statement, May 2015).

PLEASE NOTE: For any of the above categories of programmes, providers must ensure programmes are listed in the ILEP (or a provider has been granted authorisation to use the IEM) in advance of marketing to or recruiting non-EEA students. Note on Overseas accredited programmes As outlined by the report6 of the Taskforce on Students Affected by Private College Closures, overseas accredited and validated programmes were frequently used as a means of bypassing Irish quality assurance and oversight. Overseas accredited programmes are perceived to combine the highest level of immigration risk with the least strategic value for international education. Extensive revisions to the statutory framework were made in 2019 to facilitate the introduction of the IEM. The ILEP continues to give effect to the May 2015 Government Policy Statement.

In this regard, no new applications for overseas accredited or validated higher education programmes will be accepted by the Department of Justice in this or any other future cycle of the ILEP. 6 Report of the Task Force on students affected by private college closures 6 Publishing information for students Providers should not market programmes to students or recruit students to programmes in advance of achieving a programme listing in the published ILEP.

A Risk is defined as the likelihood that a person/s may be harmed, injured or suffer an adverse health effect if exposed to a hazard. Once the hazard has been identified and the level of risk assessed then the necessary steps can be taken to control, eliminate or minimize the risk to safety. 4.3 Hazard Identification This is the first step in the control of health and safety risks and involves a critical appraisal of all activities. In performing hazard identification there will be ongoing critical appraisal of all routine and non-routine activities throughout the College. Hazards are classified into three categories: 1. Physical hazards 2. Chemical hazards 3. Psychological hazards Rev-3 (Mar 2019) 1. Physical Hazards The following are a list of physical hazards — it is not exhaustive. e Manual Handling Equipment Slips/Trips/Falls Fire Machinery/moving parts Electricity Hot substances Poor housekeeping Vibration Sharps 2. Chemical Hazards The following are a list of chemical hazards. e Gases Dust Fumes Liquids Vapor Solvents Acids Aerosols Carcinogens Sensitizing agents Allergens 3.

Psychological Hazards The following are a list of psychological hazards. e Bullying/Harassment Stress Inadequate training Inadequate supervision Long hours 4.4 Risk Assessment A Risk Assessment is an examination of what hazards in the workplace could cause harm so that a decision can be made on whether enough controls are in place to prevent harm occurring. Risk assessment is required under Section 19 of the Safety, Health & Welfare at Work Act 2005. The risks will be characterized into High, Medium or Low. HIGH RISK = there is a possibility of serious injury (fatalities, amputations, serious diseases, paralysis) to a number of people and a possibility of significant injury (moderate injury, damages, lacerations) and material loss. MEDIUM RISK = there is a possibility of minor injury (cuts, abrasions, sprains) to a number of people and a possibility of some material loss. LOW RISK = there is a possibility of little injury to a small number of people or the risk of material loss is low. Rev-3 (Mar 2019) The steps are: 1. Carry out the risk assessment. 2. Decide who might be harmed and how. 3.

Decide the control measures to prevent the hazard occurring, to eliminate it or substitute it as far as reasonably practicable. 4. Record the findings. The Risk Assessments depend on the following: e Is anyone exposed to the hazard Is the hazard likely to cause injury How serious would the injury be Is the hazard well controlled Is the level of supervision adequate How long people were exposed and what are the levels of exposure, (temperature, chemicals, noise, heavy loads, etc.) that should not be exceeded. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act requires employers to carry out identification of hazards and an assessment of risks posed by those hazards. The ultimate goal of hazard identification and risk assessment is to devise and implement appropriate controls to ensure, as is reasonably practicable, that the risk is reduced to an acceptable level. Each Head of Faculty/Department and Line Manager must: e Identify their significant hazards e Assess the magnitude of the risk which arises e Inform the Health and Safety Officer of their concerns. This information will be forwarded to the Safety Coordinator to update the safety statement documentation.

Head of Faculty/Department and Line Managers: When a hazard is identified he/she shall examine the various options available to eliminate the hazard. If the problem can only be resolved by significant expenditure he/she shall present the options available to the Health and Safety Officer. Where the risk cannot be reduced to an acceptable level and finance is not available to implement appropriate controls then the activity must cease or the area must be closed off. 5.0 CONTROL MEASURES Risks are adequately controlled if: e Adequate information, instruction or training is provided e Adequate systems and procedures are provided e Hazard meets the legal requirement standard e Precautions comply with recognized industry standard, good practice, reduce risk as far as reasonably practicable.

If risks are not adequately controlled then: e Remove the risk completely e Substitute e Organize work to reduce the exposure to the hazard e Apply safety measures (machine guards, ventilation, mechanical handling methods etc.) to reduce the risk e Administer controls (supervision, etc.) which reduce or eliminate exposure to the hazard by adherence to procedures or instructions e Ensure clean and tidy workplace e Issue personal protective equipment (PPE) 15 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) 5.1 Physical Hazards These hazards include furniture and work equipment, noise, vibration, light, temperature, access to heights and violence.

Control Measures — Furniture and Work Equipment e The College will purchase furniture and work equipment which is sound and suitable for use and which complies with appropriate Irish and European standards. e All furniture and work equipment should be used solely for the purpose for which it is intended. e All equipment must be operated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. e Damaged furniture and work equipment which is deemed unsafe should be removed immediately from use and the Campus Services/Facilities Department informed to ensure it is stored to prevent its accidental reuse before repair or replacement. e Staff responsible for purchasing furniture and work equipment must ensure the selection process has taken account of the specific conditions in the place of work and any additional hazards caused by its installation. e Staff responsible for supervising the use of furniture and work equipment must ensure it is properly maintained. e Work equipment, when purchased, must be maintained and tested to manufactures recommendations and statutory requirements. Control Measures — Noise The noise level in the College will normally be below 85dB and therefore does not pose a risk.

If any works or activities are to take place on the campus that exceed the 85Db limit, appropriate steps will be taken to eliminate, reduce and control noise levels to a safe level. Control Measures — Vibration Staff who work with machinery and/or tools which cause whole body vibration of hand/arm vibration must wear the appropriate protective personal protective equipment. Heads of Faculty/Department are responsible for supervising the use of PPE and to ensure the equipment is maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Control Measures — Light The following guidelines should be applied to ensure adequate lighting. e Have adequate lighting for the task Avoid glare Avoid flicker in light sources Avoid flicker in visual display units. Control Measures — Temperature Comfortable temperature levels for all work areas should be maintained. The Campus Services/Facilities department should be contacted if temperatures are above or below comfortable levels so that appropriate action is taken. Control Measures — Violence The College employs trained Security personnel who are trained in dealing with violent and aggressive behavior and situations.

Any staff member who feels under threat should phone Security (See Appendix 1.3 for contact details). ‘ 16 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) Control Measures — Lone working Staff and contractors who work after normal working hours alone or in areas of personal isolation should take the following precautions Inform site Security or Campus Services/Facilities that you are working after hours and your expected finishing time. Keep in regular contact with a member of the site Security or Campus Services/Facilities. Where available carry a man-down device, lone working device or personal alarm. Control Measures — Safe Access/Exit The College will, so far as is reasonably practicable, provide and maintain a safe access and exit to and from any employee/contractors place of work and for students and visitors while on the campus. ° Emergency exit doors and exit routes are clearly sign-posted and Heads of Faculty/Department and line mangers have responsibility for ensuring that such doors and exit routes are kept clear of obstructions. Suitable equipment is provided such as foot-stools, ladders or cherry-picker where access to high levels is necessary, such as for maintenance or to access goods stored above head height.

The security staff control the movement of cars on the campus and both monitor and control traffic management on the site Adequate lighting of all areas around the campus, including the car-park has been provided. Walkways are clearly highlighted. Users of the car-park are required to take due care and be considerate of all other car-park users and to report any incidents or concerns to a member of the Security Staff. The Campus Services/Facilities staff and contractors carry out routine repairs and maintenance for both internal and external areas of the campus. Control Measures — Safe Use of Equipment It is College policy to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that all personnel shall be protected from all known machinery and equipment hazards through the use of built in safety equipment features, approved safe guards, training and operating procedures. New equipment will display CE marking to show compliance with all relevant safety standards. eoe3ee 17 The Head of Faculty/Department will ensure when purchasing new machinery/equipment that the vendor provides written instructions for the safe use and care of the machines or equipment, operating instructions, maintenance procedures and safety devices.

Staff will only operate/clean the machinery/equipment when trained to do so. Staff will take great care when using pins, staplers and guillotines. When safety features are incorporated into equipment, these must be used. The Head of Faculty/Department will ensure operating instructions are available for all machines/equipment. Machinery must only be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The operator of any machinery or equipment on site must be trained to do so before use. All guards must be fitted correctly, robust, working and be effective. The area around any machine or piece of equipment must be clean, tidy and free from obstruction. The Head of Faculty/Department must be informed immediately if any piece of machinery or equipment that is under their remit is not working, or not working correctly. The appropriate PPE must be worn. Rev-3 (Mar 2019) Control Measures — Manual Handling Manual handling includes lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying or putting down a load. The main injuries associated with manual handling are: e Back strain/slipped disc. e Hernias e Lacerations, crushing of hands or fingers e Bruised or broken toes or feet e Various sprains, strains, etc.

Legislation advocates the use of mechanical equipment for the handling of loads by employees. Employees are given manual handling training where applicable. Line Manager's Responsibilities It is the responsibility of all Managers to eliminate the need for any unnecessary manual handling. It is the responsibility of all Managers to ensure that no person will be expected to lift, carry, or move a load that would be likely to cause him / her injury. This includes all pushing, pulling, carrying, putting down, or moving of any load and where possible, a trolley or hand truck must be provided. When manual handling is unavoidable, the work must be planned and personnel engaged in lifting must utilize safe manual handling techniques and use any lifting aids and equipment available In planning the work to be done, the line manager must assess the risks presented by the: e Working Environment Characteristics of the Load Individual capacity Physical effort required Distance involved. Frequency of Task. The Line Manager must ensure an.employee is not put at risk because he/she: e Is physically unsuited to carry out the task in question Is wearing unsuitable clothing, footwear, or other personal affects.

Does not have adequate or appropriate knowledge or training. Ensure that no employee will lift or attempt to lift any object of excessive weight Ensure the characteristics of the load is examined prior to lifting as the manual handling of a load may present a risk of back injury if it is: o Too heavy or too large. o Unwieldy or difficult to grasp. o Unstable or has contents likely to shift. o Positioned in a manner requiring it to be held or manipulated at a distance from the trunk, or with a bending or twisting of the trunk; Likely, because of its contours and. or consistency, to result in injury to workers particularly in the event of a collision o Ifan object is too heavy, help must be obtained (as a guide, a load which exceeds fifty percent of the individuals body weight should be regarded as a risk). o Examine the load for splinters, sharp edges, projecting nails and sharp wire. © Before a load is lifted, obstructions must be removed, snags must be noted and a space cleared where the load is to be set down.

Ensure that it is possible to see over the load when it is being carried. ° Staff will be trained in manual handling as required. 18 Rey-3 (Mar 2019) To Lift: Stand with your feet slightly apart. Bend the Knees. Keep the back straight though not necessarily vertical, and ensure the spine is not bent over at the bottom. A firm grip should be obtained with the palm of the hand and the root of the fingers - using the finger tips means more effort and more chance of dropping the load. Arms should be as close to the body as possible so that the body takes the weight instead of the fingers, wrist arm and shoulder muscles. If possible, the opposite corners of the object should be gripped. Lifting should be done by the thigh muscles by straightening the legs, lift by easy stages, i.e. from floor to knee and from knee to carrying position. When carrying, do not change grip - rest the load on some firm support and then change. Move in the direction of your feet; do not twist your truck to change direction. To set the load down, reverse the lifting procedure.

Gloves should be worn when handling sharp or slippery objects. Standing with heavy loads should be avoided. Ensure that the route, over which the load is being carried, is clear and free from obstructions to prevent trips or falls. When a load is being carried by more than one person, the same basic principles must apply as above. People must work as a team and be given instructions by one person only. Wearing rings on fingers is not recommended. Control Measures — Electricity Electrical installations and repairs must be carried out by a competent electrician. All new electrical equipment will comply with the required CE quality standard. Ensure that suitable precautions are taken when working near overhead lines, near electrical boards and that fuses and circuit breakers are correctly rated for the circuit they protect. All portable electric tools are operated at 110 volts or battery. All connections to power points are made by plugs or are electrically hard wired. Faulty or suspect equipment, including any signs of damage to wires, plugs, sockets etc., must be reported to the Campus Services/Facilities Department immediately.

All-defective equipment must be removed from service until repairs have been carried out or replaced if repairs cannot be carried out. Sockets are not to be overloaded. All electrical equipment must be electrically isolated before any works are carried out on it. Before use all electrical equipment must be examined for any sign of damage or defect before use. The Campus Services/Facilities Manager will ensure that: e Inspections of electrical installations/equipment will be carried out as required and remedial action taken when defects are reported. e All equipment purchased, rented or leased is protected by an earth wire, or is labeled “double insulated" and that the equipment is suitably identified including its electrical rating, and the manufactures name. e Adequate protection is being provided for equipment exposed to the elements, and to adverse conditions such as damp, dust, etc. e All new electrical installations have been tested by a competent person and certified. e All distribution boards have been identified and that there is adequate access and egress to all distribution boards.

Rev-3 (Mar 2019) Employees will inspect electrical equipment to ensure: e The plug is in good condition and of the correct type; e The cable is properly secured with a cord clamp over the outer insulation & is free from external damage and “taped up” repairs. e Both the appliance and the power socket are switched off before plugging the appliance into the power supply. e Their hands are dry before operating switches or using electrical equipment e Extension leads are fitted with proper fused plugs and NEVER make connections by inserting a bare wire into a socket. e Leads are not frayed or near pinch points, sharp objects, heat, water and rough surfaces e Leads will not cause a tripping hazard. e Employees will inspect electrical equipment for obvious defects before use. Electrical Defects 1, Immediately disconnect the equipment from the electric supply if is safe to do so. 2. Place an "Out of Order - Do Not Use" notice on the equipment. 3. Ifthe equipment cannot be unplugged, it must be electrically isolated by an electrician or suitable qualified person 4. Report the defect to his/her Line Manager. 5.

The equipment must not be used until the problem has been resolved. 6. Never attempt to carry out any repairs on electrical equipment, unless you qualified to do so. Electric Shock 1. Immediately disconnect the electrical equipment from the electric supply (if possible and safe to do so) 2. Never attempt to carry out electrical repairs unless you are qualified to do so. 3. To avoid electric shock, keep electric wiring away from wet floors and surfaces. 4. Ensure that plugs are fully placed in power sockets. 5. Ifyou or anyone else has suffered an electrical shock, contact a site first aider for treatment and inform a member of the Campus Services/Facilities team immediately. 6. Never use electrical equipment outdoors unless it is designed for that purpose Control Measures.— Slips, Trips and Falls The College shall, as far as is reasonably practicable, ensure all floors, steps, stairs, corridors, and ladders, are of sound construction, properly maintained and kept free from obstructions or from substances likely cause a person to slip, trip or fall. Housekeeping staff have the following responsibilities: When washing floor, always erect warning signs. These signs must not be removed until the floor is dry.

Tidy up trailing buffer/vacuum machine leads, run cables along walls. Observe good-housekeeping practices at all times. All employees have the following responsibilities: 20 e Place furniture, fittings and equipment so that personnel can move about without colliding with sharp corners of desks, cabinets etc., Place filing cabinets so that there is ample room when a drawer is fully open. Do not leave drawers of desks or cabinets open to be stumbled over. Do not open more than one drawer of a filing cabinet at a time. Be careful with metal furniture, particularly shelves/drawers that may have sharp edges. Do not have trailing electrical cables. Keep cables near walls or within special cable covers. e Do not leave paper (e.g. printout sheets, files, invoices, etc.) on the floor or adjacent to computer printers, photocopiers etc. when not in use. Rev-3 (Mar 2019) e Store paper in the areas provided. e Stairways, Reception and Corridors shall be properly maintained and kept free from any materials that could give rise to unsafe conditions.

They will not be used as storage areas. e All parcels and packages must be removed from the reception area immediately on arrival. e Carry files/ boxes to ensure vision is not obstructed particularly if moving up or down stairs/steps. e Waste paper bins must be used. e All rubbish must be cleared away regularly. e Broken glass and other sharp objects must be disposed of carefully and NEVER in a waste paper bin. : e All offices and work-stations must be left in a tidy condition each evening, with all desk and other surfaces neatly arranged and nothing left on the floors. e Use safe footwear provided to avoid slipping. e Use ladder or foot stool to gain access to heights. Always observe the correct use of ladders at all times. e Ensure that any spillages are dealt with safely and safety signs must be erected until this is done. e Report any slip/trip hazard to the Head of Faculty/Department or Line Manager. e Report any area with defective lighting to the Head of Faculty/Department or Line Manager.

Control Measures — Visual Display Units (VDUs), Work stations and Breaks VDU work demands can vary widely depending on the particular task being undertaken and may vary from those that require a very high level of concentration and vigilance to more routine and infrequent activities. Legislation sets down minimum requirements for working with VDUs which also cover the operator, the desk, the chair and the work-stations. VDU’s: Like other common electrical devices (irons, toasters, televisions, florescent lights, etc.), WDUs can produce certain types of radiation which is negligible and does not constitute a health hazard, or cause permanent eye damage. The image on the screen will be stable, there will be no flickering. The screen will be free of reflective glare and reflections liable to cause discomfort. The keyboard shall have a matt surface to avoid reflective glare. Workstations: Workstations shall be arranged so that the general use of the equipment shall not be a source of risk to the user. Lighting conditions should be of an appropriate standard to ensure contrast between screen and background environment.

Possible disturbing glare and reflections on the screen or other equipment shall be prevented by coordinating the layout of the workstations and the artificial light sources. Where necessary local illumination will be provided. However, the light from such a lamp must not impinge on the display screen or surrounding area. The chair shall be stable and allow the user a comfortable position and freedom of movement. The seat will be adjustable in height and the seat back will be adjustable in height and tilt. A foot rest will be available to any user who requires one. Work Breaks: If display screen work involves intensive use of the keyboard or reading the screen, or a mixture of the two, the work should be broken by periods of non-intensive, non-display screen work. The line manager will assist in organizing work to ensure the employee receives suitable breaks in VDU work. Short breaks away from the screen, e.g. five to ten minutes following fifty to sixty minutes of 21 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) continuous screen and keyboard work is likely to be more beneficial than a fifteen minute break every two hours.

If a staff member experiences discomforts such as hand, shoulder or eyestrain, they should bring it to the attention of their Line Manager immediately. Control Measures — Storage Line Managers must ensure: e That adequate storage is provided in their department. e Where necessary, ensure shelving is properly secured and sharp edges are removed. e The hazards of jewelry creating a risk of fingers and limbs being trapped in metal rack units must be brought to the notice of staff. e All chemicals, equipment and materials are stored correctly and in accordance material safety data sheets and manufacturers recommendations. Employees must: e Where possible place heavy items on lower shelves e Not overload shelves. e Never overload top drawers of filing cabinets and desk drawers or open more than one drawer at a time as this may cause the cabinet or drawer to tip over. Follow their line managers or safety representative guidance and instruction on correct storage. Access to Heights To access high shelves a stepladder or step stool must be used and these can be provided by the Facilities department. It is not permitted to stand on chairs, desks, shelves, racking, boxes etc.

Use of Ladders: Before using a stepladder, check the following condition to ensure it is safe: e All hardware is tight, or secure, as necessary All step rungs are present, not coated in grease, oil, cracked or loose. The ladder assembly is rigid enough to take your weight The front and back feet are opened to their full extent permitted by the cords or restrains. That all four feet are firmly on the ground so that the ladder does not wobble. Never take heavy or bulky objects, which may cause it to overbalance, or them to drop the object and cause injury to others. e Never work from the toe step of a ladder unless it is on the platform type and fitted with a hand-rail. e Take care when reaching from a sideways position as this could result in the ladder overturning, or the loss of balance. 5.2 Chemical Hazards The College has to use chemical substances. These range from detergents and aerosol sprays to corrective fluids. The College recognizes that the use of chemicals entails some risk to personnel or the environment either through normal handling or accidental spillage.

The College ensures, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety and prevention of risk to health at work in connection with the use of any article or substance. Control Measures — Material Data Sheets (MSDS) Material safety data sheets are available for all chemicals used within the College. All Faculties and departments need to maintain MSDS’s for any chemical that they are using, storing or disposing MSDS are an important source of information and any employee using a chemical must become familiar with the appropriate sheet. 22 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) The MSDS gives the following information: Hazard identification First aid measures Firefighting measures Accidental release Handling and storage e Exposure controls and personal protection etc. It is the College's policy that all chemicals used within the College will have a precautionary label on the container and will, as far is reasonably practicable, provide additional information through the provision of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) Employees must: Read and understand all precautionary labels on chemical containers and MSDSs. Look for the important information - is the substance toxic, harmful, corrosive or an irritant etc.?

For example, the label on a container of typical office correction fluid will warn that the liquid is flammable and is harmful if inhaled or swallowed. Use, handle, store and dispose of the chemicals as directed by the above information and use any necessary protective equipment and clothing. Control Measures — Carcinogens Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Carcinogens) Regulations, 2015 specify certain measures necessary to protect workers from the risks resulting from exposure to carcinogens including: Risk assessment of carcinogen use in the workplace Implementation of appropriate steps to eliminate or minimise exposure Maintain an up to date list of employees at risk of exposure to carcinogens. The list will be complied based on information obtained from the Heads of Faculty/Departments where carcinogens are in use. Employees exposed to carcinogens in the course of their work are to be consulted and provided with information and training on the hazards and risks of carcinogen use and the measures to deal with unforeseen risks Appropriate records of assessments will be maintained by the Faculty/Department and the Health and Safety Officer.

Control Measures — Chemical Usage e Chemicals should be used strictly in accordance with the manufacturer instructions and the MSDS. e Chemicals should be stored as per the MSDS. e Empty containers should be disposed of safely as per the MSDS e All chemicals must be labeled e Smoking, eating and drinking is prohibited where dangerous substances are being used and stored. e Employees must be aware of warning symbols on the containers. e Dangerous chemicals must be kept in minimum quantities and stored appropriately. e Chemicals and dangerous substances should be eliminated/substituted by a less dangerous substances as far as is reasonably practicable. e Provide adequate ventilation if noxious fumes have been emitted. e Protective clothing must be worn if this is a requirement when using the chemical. e Material safety data sheets (MSDS) must be observed before using any chemical. 23 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) Housekeeping staff have the following responsibilities: e Wear gloves when handling detergents, cleaning agents. e Do not mix cleaning materials unless permitted by instructions. e Bleaches should never be mixed with toilet cleaners or other cleaning products as they give rise to toxic chlorine fumes. e Should be aware where the MSDS for a chemical is available from and what the requirements for each chemical is in relation to usage, storage, dilution, disposal etc. 5.3 Psychological Hazards Psychological hazards include Bullying, Harassment and Stress Control Measures — Prevention of Bullying and Harassment The Health and Safety Authority! defines Bullying as ‘Workplace bullying is repeated inappropriate behavior, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at a place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual’s right to dignity at work’.

An isolated incident of the behavior described in this definition may be an-affront to dignity at work but as a once off incident is not considered to be bullying. All staff are required to be familiar with and to adhere to the College Dignity at Work policy (policy number 10). This policy is available from the HR department and should be checked regularly for updates. The Employment Equality Acts define Harassment as ‘Harassment is any form of unwanted conduct related to any of the discriminatory grounds, being conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the person’. The Acts sets out that the unwanted conduct may consist of acts, requests, spoken words, gestures, or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures, or other material. All staff are required to be familiar with and to adhere to the College Dignity at Work policy, the key points of the policy are detailed below.

Sexual Harassment The Employment Equality Acts define Sexual Harassment as ‘Sexual Harassment is any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature being conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the person’. The Acts sets out that the unwanted conduct may consist of acts, requests, spoken words, gestures, or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures, or other material. It is up to each employee to decide what behavior is unwelcome, irrespective of the attitude of others, and from whom such behavior is unwelcome. The fact that the employee has previously tolerated the behavior does not stop him/her from deciding that it has now become unwelcome and objecting to it. In determining whether behavior is unwelcome it is the effect of the behavior on the employee concerned rather than the intent of the person engaging in the unwelcome behavior that is important. The person engaging in the conduct must be made aware that the conduct is unwelcome where: 1. It is not obvious on reasonable grounds to construe the action as offensive, humiliating or intimidating. 2.

The action from the person has been acceptable in the past. 3. The employee accepts the conduct from other people. ' HSA Code of Practice for employers and employees on the prevention and resolution of Bullying at Work. 24 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) Responsibilities The Employer Responsibilities e To ensure that adequate resources are made available resources to promote respect and dignity in the workplace and to deal effectively with complaints of bullying and harassment. e To ensure that the college Dignity at Work Policy is communicated to all staff e To ensure that all staff are made aware of their responsibilities to create a working environment which is free from bullying and harassment. All Employees’ Responsibilities ¢ To help maintain a working environment in which the dignity of all individuals is respected. e¢ Tocomply with the college Dignity at Work Policy. e To ensure that their behavior does not cause offence to fellow workers or any person with whom they come into contact during the course of their work. e To discourage bullying and harassment by objecting to inappropriate behavior. e To inform a Manager if they are concerned that a colleague is being bullied or harassed.

Each Line Managers’ Responsibilities e To implement the college Dignity at Work Policy e To make every effort to ensure that bullying and harassment does not occur, particularly in work areas for which they are responsible. e To deal promptly and effectively with any incidents of bullying or harassment of which they are aware or ought to be aware. e To explain the Dignity at Work Policy to all staff and ensure understanding and how the complaints procedures operate. Promote ongoing awareness of the policy among staff. Set a good example by treating people with dignity and respect. Be vigilant for signs of bullying and harassment and intervene before a problem escalates. Respond sensitively to any member of staff who make a complaint of bullying or harassment. Respond promptly to requests from employees to intervene and seek to resolve the matter informally where appropriate. e Ensure that an employee is not victimized for making a complaint of bullying or harassment in good faith. e Monitor and follow up the situation after a complaint is made so that the behavior complained of does not recur. e Keep a record of all complaints and how these were resolved.

Control Measures — Stress Stress occurs when an individual perceives an imbalance between the demands placed on him/her and his/her ability to cope. Work related stress results from an interaction of the individual and the working environment. What is stressful for one employee may not be stressful to another employee. An employee who has work related stress should raise the matter with his/her line manager who may arrange for a Risk assessment to be carried out. 5.4 Control Measures — Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE is defined as all equipment (including clothing affording protection against the weather) which is intended to be worn or held by a person at work and which protects him/her against one or more risks to his/her health or safety. PPE includes (but is not exclusive to): e Safety head wear e Gloves e Eye protection e Safety footwear 25 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) e Safety harnesses e Hearing protection Where there are risks to the safety, health and welfare of employees, the College will avoid or limit such risks whenever possible by other methods of prevention or control such as, engineering controls or safe systems of work before resorting to the use of PPE.

The College will provide suitable PPE where the risks cannot be avoided or sufficiently reduced. If PPE is required for your job, then you must by law, use it. Failure to do so may result in injury and may lead to disciplinary action Employees must: e Use provided PPE. e Maintain and store the PPE correctly so it is maintained in good condition. e Beaware that a breach of rules regarding the wearing of PPE will lead to disciplinary action. Line Mangers must: e Inform their staff of the risks for which PPE is provided. e Instruct and train their staff in the use of PPE. e Supply the necessary PPE Contractors must: e All contractors must supply PPE for their own employees (where applicable) e PPE must be worn by contractors as set out in their risk assessment or as per College requirements. Safety Head Wear Must be worn when working in an area where there is a risk of head injuries due to falling objects, low head clearance (low beams, pipes, equipment etc.) or extreme cold conditions or direct sunlight for prolonged periods.

Gloves Gloves chosen must offer the best protection for the specific and/or chemical that they are intended to be used for. Gloves must be worn where there is specific risk to the hands, including abrasion, temperature extremes, chemicals, electric shock or vibration. Gloves must be changed when they are no longer fit for purpose and no longer offer the protection that is required. They must then be disposed of properly. Gloves must not be worn where they could get caught in a machine or if wearing them creates a greater risk than the reason that they are being worn for. Eye Protection Eye protection (safety glasses with side shields, goggles, and face shield) must be worn where there is arisk of sparks, splashes, dust, vapour etc. to the eyes. High pressure cleaning/spray equipment and work involving power tools require safety glasses with side shields and welding operations require tinted safety glasses with side shields. Safety Footwear Safety shoes are provided where hazards exist such as wet floors, falling objects or chemical splashes. Maintenance staff, Household staff and Security Staff must wear safety shoes. Safety Harness These must be worn where there is a danger of falling from a height.

They are located in the Campus Services/Facilities department. Company harnesses are inspected before use and are inspected annually by a suitably qualified person. Any equipment that is found defective is taken out of service and repaired or replaced. 26 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) Hearing Protection Earplugs and earmuffs are provided and must be worn where the noise level is 80Db or above or if nuisance noise is prevalent. Hearing protection must not be worn if it is dangerous to do so (e.g. area of traffic, when an alarm will be difficult to hear while wearing) Some employees may be required to wear other types of PPE, please contact your line manager for assistance. 5.5 Control Measures — Segregation of Waste Waste produced in the College is divided into: 1. Non-risk waste including household/domestic waste — food, paper, cardboard, magazines, plastic bottles, etc. Household/domestic waste is disposed of in office bins provided -liquid or broken glass must not be disposed of in these bins. 2. Hazardous waste This waste must be disposed of in an appropriate manner and through the correct waste stream due to their hazardous properties and includes: e Batteries WEEE (PCs, printers, monitors, TVs) Fluorescent tubes Photographic waste etc.

Ink cartridges When removing waste, employees must wear gloves and other appropriate PPE. Waste should not be allowed to accumulate within offices. 5.6 Control Measures - No Smoking Buildings Smoking is not permitted inside any of the College buildings. Smoking is permitted in outdoor areas of the College (unless otherwise specified) and metal ashtrays, which are emptied regularly, have been provided. Any outdoor areas where smoking is not allowed is highlighted by ‘No Smoking’ signage. Smoking areas are inspected and cleaned on a regular basis. 5.7 Control Measures - Security Employees must secure their office at the end of the day, closing all windows and doors. Employees must contact a member of the Security team if they see any person acting suspiciously. Security personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (See Appendix 1 for contact numbers) 5.8 Control Measures — Pregnant Employees The College will assess any risk on the pregnancy to the safety and health of employees and any possible effect on an employee’s pregnancy and on a breastfeeding mother resulting from any activity at work likely to involve risk.

It will take the preventative and protective measures necessary to ensure the safety and health of pregnant and breastfeeding staff. Procedure All pregnant and breastfeeding employees should inform their line manager. The line manager will review the activities carried out by the employee will they will be assessed to ensure the continued health and safety of the employee and unborn baby or child during this period. In an office environment the following hazards should be considered: e Physical shocks, including direct blows to the abdomen. e Handling a load e¢ Movement and postures which are abrupt or severe or give rise to excessive fatigue. e Non-ionizing radiation. 27 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) e A pregnant employee must not be exposed to these hazards unless they are adequately controlled i.e. the hazard is reduced to a level which will not harm the pregnant woman, the developing child or breast fed child. If any of these risks are present, they must either be eliminated or safeguards put in place to protect the employee’s health and safety. These safeguards include: e Changing the type of work, working hours, ete. e Moving the employee to another work area.

If these safeguards are not possible then the employee must be granted safety and health leave. This is paid leave that continues until either the conditions change or else the pregnant employee becomes eligible for paid maternity leave. 6.0 FIRE AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT When a fire or other emergency occurs activities must be coordinated and critical decisions made, usually under considerable stress and the first few minutes when waiting for outside assistance are especially crucial. We must prepare for emergencies so that personal injury, property loss, and business interruptions will be minimized. 6.1 Means of Escape Escape routes are provided throughout the College to allow evacuation in the shortest time possible. All staff must ensure: e Corridors, stairs and escape routes are not obstructed and are clear for use at all times. Exit routes are not obstructed outside the building. Escape routes are clearly marked and adequately lit. Escape doors are capable of being readily and easily opened at all times.

Floor coverings do not present a slip or trip hazard in any escape route. 6.2 Emergency Drills e Emergency evacuation drills will be organized a minimum of four a year by the Safety Coordinators in conjunction with Security/ the security team. Feedback of performance in terms of time taken to evacuate and particular difficulties will be provided to the Safety Officer and to the management board. Where the performance in a fire drill falls below the required standard, further drills will be carried out to confirm that the required standard has been met. e The evacuation procedure is available from Security, Griffith Reception and all lecture rooms (GCD Dublin) 6.3 Fire Alarms The College has a number of fire detection and fire alarm systems to improve the chances the site being altered to a possible fire and to take actions to evacuate a building and restrict the spread of fire. The fire control panels are monitored and any fault warning will receive prompt attention by the Security and or the Campus Services/Facilities staff. The detection systems identifies the location of the fire. Upon activation of the ‘Break Glass’ unit, the fire alarms will be activated in that building.

Fire alarm systems are serviced and maintained regularly. All alarm activations are investigated by the Security staff. e The fire alarms will be activated and the buildings evacuated whenever, a fire, or other incident occurs which endangers persons inside the buildings. e The "Alert" signal is sounded by an intermittent siren and staff must prepare to evacuate the building. 28 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) e The ‘Evacuation’ signal is given by a continuous siren.

Throughout the College are: e BREAK GLASS UNITS - to raise the alarm. e AUTOMATIC HEAT AND SMOKE DETECTORS ~- to detect a fire. e AUDIBLE SOUNDERS ~- to alert staff/students in the event of a fire. 6.4 Firefighting Equipment The Campus has various Fire Fighting Equipment Fire Extinguishers Fire Hose Reels (Griffith College Dublin only) Fire Blankets (Griffith College Dublin only) Fire Hydrants (Griffith College Dublin only) Fire Suppression Systems - Protecting cook equipment and extract ductwork (Griffith College Dublin only) Various types of fire extinguishers are located throughout the College to: e Extinguish a fire e Protect means of escape in the case of a fire e Protect staff and students in the case of a fire e Protect property in the case of a fire The College uses an external expert to carry out regular inspections of the firefighting equipment and the date of the inspection is recorded each piece of equipment. Access to all firefighting equipment must be kept clear at all times. Employees may not remove or tamper with any piece of firefighting equipment.

It is policy that you should not tackle a fire with firefighting equipment unless a fire hampers your means of egress. 6.5 Emergency Lighting Emergency lighting provides lighting to indicate the escape routes towards the exits and assists emergency services in rescue and firefighting. This lighting is normally powered by the main electricity supply, in emergency situations it is powered by a generator or by the battery unit in the unit itself. The College uses an external expert to carry out regular inspections of the emergency lighting. 6.6 Fire Doors A fire door must not be left in the open position, unless fitted with an automatic door closure activated by a fire alarm. 6.7 Fire Policy The College Fire Policy outlines: e Duties of the College Fire Marshals e What to do on hearing the fire alarm What to do on discovering a fire 6.8 Duties of College Fire Marshals Each building will have at least one designated fire warden present at all times.

Fire wardens will assist in the evacuation of staff and students from a building and restrict re-entry to a building until the ‘All Clear’ is given by the Fire Brigade, Safety Coordinator or Health and Safety Officer. Fire Marshals shall: e Create awareness and promote good fire safety standards in their area. e Know of any special hazards in his / her area e Know how to raise the alarm. 29 Rev-3 (Mar 2019) A list of the Fire Wardens is available from the Security Department. Also see Appendix | of this safety statement. 6.9 Fire Action - College Fire Marshals In the case of an ‘Alert’ siren, Fire Marshals have the following duties e Ensure everyone in the area is aware of the emergency. e Check that toilets, shower rooms etc. are empty. e Ensure all personnel are preparing to evacuate the building e Closing all doors and windows. In the case of an ‘Evacuation’ siren, Fire Marshals have the following duties e Ensure all employees leave the building by the nearest exit and that no one is left behind in the toilets/shower room etc. Organize assistance for any person who requires it.

Examples of volunteering roles and projects undertaken by learners can vary hugely depending on the learners’ particular interests, skill sets, and the needs in the specific community they wish to advance Through their voluntary support, learners can gain valuable experience and insights into the particular circumstances and needs of others, and can also directly advance their own interpersonal and leadership skills. These skills complement the knowledge and competences learners develop on their academic programmes, creating more informed and reflective graduates. Participation in the award is on an opt-in basis through an application process. The award welcomes a variety of applications and recognises that learners have various interests and different volunteering opportunities open to them. The committee which reviews the applications comprises a number of representatives from across the College’s faculties and support departments.

Learners who are added to the President’s Roll of Honour receive a medal in recognition of their contribution and a letter of merit from the President of Griffith College. The letter of merit is awarded at Gold, Silver or Bronze in recognition of the effort shown and the learning from participation in the activity. ## Student of the Year At every Griffith College Graduation ceremony, one exemplary student wins the “Student of the Year” and they are given a prize by the College President in recognition of their high achievements academically, along with other factors which have enhanced their student experience and that of their classmates. ## Faculty Awards Griffith College also has a long and illustrious history of award-winners and prize recipients.

This means that the learning objectives for all our courses are based on real world language use and mapped from the Common European Framework.

Perfect for anyone wishing to do further study or work in an English-speaking country. It is available in two formats: Academic and General.

Our goal as a school is not for students to have learned a set of grammar items but to be able to express their thoughts in English as they do in their own language.

This means that the learning objectives for all our courses are based on real world language use and mapped from the Common European Framework. ## Stay Connected: ## Dublin North Great Campus: (01) 244 0377 Mountjoy Campus: (01) 224 3439 info@erincollege.wp1.sh ## Contact Info: ## Cork Campus: (021) 203 8577 info.cork@erincollege.wp1.sh ## Terms and conditions: Dublin & Cork ## Feedback Form ## Privacy Policy ## Student Handbook ## Advantage Programme Copyright © 2023 Erin College.

Complaints Procedure This document outlines the process followed in the event of the school receiving a complaint. 1) Complaints are made to reception or sent via email to info@erincollege.com for Dublin students or info.cork@erincollege.com for Cork students 2) All complaints are forwarded to the relevant department. 3) A member of management or student support will meet the student to discuss the issue, if it is deemed necessary. ● If the issue concerns the class, the DoS/ADoS observes the class and gives feedback. ● If the issue is about a teacher, the DoS/ADoS advises the teacher (if deemed necessary) and records the details of the complaint, the DoS/ADoS observes the class and gives feedback about how the issue could be resolved. ● If the complaint is made in relation to the behaviour of another student, a member of management or student support will meet with both students concerned and attempt to mediate and resolve the difficulties. ● If the issue concerns the DoS/ADoS, the Head of Academics will deal with the matter. 4) Management will consult with any relevant departments to resolve the issue and a decision as to how to solve the problem will be made within 5 working days. 5) If this fails to resolve the issue the Director of Operations meets with the parties concerned.

This framework provides essential guidance for school staff in handling disciplinary situations, promoting consistency and uniformity in responses to behavioral issues. By establishing transparent protocols, the college aims to uphold a culture of accountability while ensuring that students understand the expectations for their behavior, ultimately supporting their personal growth and academic success. The following rules and procedures should ensure that: – The correct procedure is used when inviting a student to a disciplinary hearing; – Students are fully aware of the correct procedure, the standards of performance, action and behaviour required of you; – Disciplinary action, where necessary, is taken speedily and in a fair, uniform and consistent manner;– On occasion it may be necessary for the company to conduct an investigation meeting to clarify a particular incident or occurrence prior to any potential disciplinary hearing. The purpose of this investigatory meeting is to establish the facts about a particular incident or occurrence, and the details of which will remain completely confidential. The investigation will be carried out by a designated member of the Management team or, if necessary, in the case of any possible conflict of interest, an agreed external third party.

In either case, the person nominated will have appropriate training and experience and be familiar with the procedures involved. The designated investigator will meet with you and any witnesses or other relevant persons individually. The person investigating the complaints will make every effort to carry out and complete the investigation as quickly as possible. The investigation meeting itself should not be interpreted as a disciplinary hearing as no disciplinary sanction would ever be issued on foot of an investigatory meeting. Instead, the facts established in an investigatory meeting may be used to identify whether or not a formal disciplinary hearing ought to be conducted; – On some occasions temporary suspension from the school or moving a student to a different class may be necessary in order that an uninterrupted investigation can take place. This should not be regarded as disciplinary action or a penalty of any kind;– Other than for an ‘off the record’ informal reprimand, students have the right to be accompanied by a student support agent or friend, who may act as a witness or speak on the student’s behalf, at any stage of the formal disciplinary process.

However they are not there to answer questions on the student’s behalf. In addition, in line with the Code of Practice for Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures, there is no provision for legal representation at any stage of the disciplinary process. If the student’s chosen companion is unavailable at the time of the hearing the company should suggest a reasonable alternative time that is no more than five working days after the original time of the hearing.

Should the chosen companion continue to be unavailable the Company may require the student to nominate an alternative representative and the hearing go ahead as scheduled. – Students will not normally be expelled for a first breach of discipline, except in the case of Gross Misconduct or SOSG (Some Other Substantial Grounds); – Students will only be disciplined after careful investigation of the facts and the opportunity to present their side of the case at a disciplinary hearing; and – If a student is disciplined, that student will receive an explanation of the penalty imposed and will have the right to appeal against the finding and the penalty. – The disciplinary procedure may be implemented at any stage if the student’s conduct or performance warrants such action.– The student will be invited via email to attend a formal disciplinary meeting at a reasonable place and time. At this meeting, the student will be able to state their case in response to the allegations against the student. The student will be given reasonabletime to prepare for the meeting.

The student will be expected to take all reasonable steps to attend the meeting.– Where appropriate, information obtained during or relating to the disciplinary processwill be kept confidential. It is not practicable to specify all the disciplinary rules or offenses which may result in disciplinaryaction, as they may vary depending on the nature of the situation. In addition to the specificexamples of misconduct and Gross Misconduct shown in this handbook, a breach of otherconditions, procedures, rules etc. within this handbook or supplementary handbooks or memoswill also result in the disciplinary procedure being used to deal with such matters. The following are examples of Minor Misconduct. Please note that this is a non-exhaustive list: – Failure to bring required materials to class: Not bringing a physical copy of the course book or other required materials. – Disregarding teacher instructions: Refusing to follow the teacher’s instructions or refusing to participate in class activities.– Inappropriate use of cell phone: Consistently using a cell phone or other personal devices during class. The following are examples of Major Misconduct.

Please note that this is a non-exhaustive list: – Disrespectful behavior: Being rude to other students or school staff, using insulting language, or engaging in objectionable behavior.– Unauthorized use of school facilities: Using school email, internet, or other resources inappropriately or without permission.– Non-compliance with instructions and policies: Failing to follow reasonable instructions from teachers or school staff or disregarding school rules and procedures. – Inappropriate vocal expression: Raising one’s voice, shouting, or using inappropriate language in school.– Failure to report damage: Not reporting any damage to school property or premises immediately after it occurs.– Ignoring safety procedures: Failing to comply with standard safety protocols while on school grounds. The following are examples of gross misconduct. If you are found to have engaged in any of the behaviors below, you will be subject to immediate dismissal from the school.

This list is not exhaustive: – Indecent or immoral behavior: Actions that are grossly inappropriate or violate the moral standards of the school community.– Discrimination or harassment: Any deliberate acts of unlawful discrimination, serious harassment, or other serious breach of the school’s Terms and Conditions.– Violent or dangerous behavior: Fighting, physical assault, or any behavior that endangers the safety of others.– Theft: Stealing from the school, its staff, classmates, or other individuals (this includes taking or using school property, materials, or resources without authorization).– Fraud: Deliberate falsification of records, including attempts to alter attendance records, or any deliberate attempt to deceive or defraud the school, staff, or classmates.– Vandalism: Purposefully damaging, destroying, or sabotaging school property or the property of others on school premises.– Health and safety violations: Serious breaches of health and safety rules that endanger the lives or well-being of classmates, school staff, or any person on school property.– Misuse of school property or name: Interfering with or improperly using school facilities or the school’s name.– Inappropriate online activity: Deliberately accessing internet sites containing pornographic, offensive, or obscene material while on school property or using school devices.– Abuse of school policies: Misusing the school’s harassment or other protective policies.– Intoxicants on school grounds: Bringing intoxicating substances onto school property or attending classes while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

The school maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward intoxicants.– Possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs: Bringing, using, or supplying illicit drugs on school property.– Serious negligence: Engaging in behaviours that cause harm, damage, or injury to others through negligence or carelessness.– Gross negligence or carelessness: Any behaviour or failure to follow school safety protocols that jeopardizes the health and safety of classmates, staff, or the general public. a)We reserve the right at our discretion for the authority to bypass any step in the disciplinary process if we feel that the severity of the action warrants it. We will be fair in the application of such discretion.b)It is not always necessary to use the formal disciplinary procedure if problems are dealt with early. Minor issues can be dealt with by counselling in the first instance, followed by an informal warning.c)In cases of gross misconduct, the earlier stages of the procedure will not apply. If gross misconduct is found to have taken place, this will result in immediate expulsion In the event of a warning, it will generally apply as follows: an oral or first written warning will remain active for eight months.

At any stage in the disciplinary procedure and in particular where gross misconduct is alleged, the school reserves the right to expel the student prior to the disciplinary meeting being held and a decision being reached. If the student is expelled the student will not be entitled to access any of the school’s premises except at the prior request or with the prior consent of the school and subject to such conditions as the school may impose. a)The disciplinary rules and procedure which form part of the student’s contractincorporate the right to lodge an appeal in respect of expulsion except when theexpulsion was due to misconduct of behavior b)The student must send an email to info@erincollege.wp1.sh (Dublin) orinfo.cork@erincollege.wp1.sh (Cork) stating that they wish to appeal the expulsion c)An expulsion appeal meeting is scheduled and conducted with one of the directors d)An investigation is conducted into the circumstances of the expulsion e)The directors make a final decision on the expulsion, if there are grounds to overturn it or not and inform the student via email of this final decision within 5 business days All students are responsible for keeping within the guidelines.

An electrically powered unit is acceptable to keep food warm but may not be used to re- heat, reconstitute or cook at the service location. • Microwaves and Toasters may only be permitted in designated kitchens with appropriate detection systems and may not be used on site. • No steam is generated that is likely to set off the fire alarm. • In the GMB, the Debating Chamber will not be used for eating, storing or preparing food. Where the following are sold/distributed/provided by Societies Clubs or an external caterer, the following will apply: Hot beverages Including Tea & coffee, Soups • Should be prepared off site and stored in Thermos Flasks as boiling water is not necessary and kettles lead to difficulties relating to Health and Safety. • No other sources of heating water may be used. Serving cold food • Food should be refrigerated prior to service and sold/distributed within 90 minutes, or disposed.

It is recommended that food is offered in ‘batches’ should the service time required extend beyond 90 minutes. No refrigeration should be used at the point of service. • Foods should not contain mayonnaise unless consumed within 1 hour as the risk of food poisoning increases as time passes. • Hand contact with unwrapped food should be kept to a minimum and appropriate hand wash facilities should be accessible. • Pre-prepared dry snacks are permitted. • Cake Sale: In the interest of fairness but without prejudice to the Junior Dean’s authority, it shall normally be the case that only one cake sale per term will be permitted to any individual University Society, Sports Club or College Publication, or to the Students’ Union, or to the Graduate Students’ Union. Alcohol • Students attending the event should be provided with no more than 2 free alcoholic drinks.

A ticketing or marking system should be in place to ensure that no individual student is provided with a greater number of free alcoholic drinks. • Alcohol may not be ‘sold’ at events unless in the context of a licensed bar. • No more than the approved number of students should be in attendance, this is the number indicated on the application form. Given that number, an estimate of the drinks requirement should be made, and larger amounts of alcohol should not be brought to the venue. • No 'cocktails' should be served, if alcohol is served it should be restricted to wine, beer or cider. • No alcohol is to be served before 18.00. • No alcohol may be consumed outside the venue. Disposal of rubbish • External Caterers must remove all waste from the event location and College after the event. • All glasses, cartons and bottles should be removed from the venue by the organisers. • All waste should be disposed of in the appropriate recycling or general waste wheelie bins. See www.tcd.ie/greenpages • The venue should be left in good condition after the event.

Should extraordinary cleaning be required, it will be a cost to the organisers and will be drawn from the booking deposit. Security • If additional security is required for the event e.g. because of the presence of VIPs or the timing or the venue for the event, the organisers are liable for the cost. __________________________________________________ Office of the Junior Dean September 2015 === ./immigration_rules/ireland-immigration/education/TCU/wp_content/uploads/2019/08/Indonesia_Guide_Why_study_a_PhD_in_Ireland_Tips_for_Indonesian_Students_v4.txt === WHY STUDY FOR A PHD IN IRELAND? 7734 Design of A4 Brochure Ref- Why study a PhD in Ireland - Tips for Indonesian Students_v4.indd 3 09/08/2019 13:53 Ireland consistently places among the TOP 10 IN THE WORLD ON INTERNATIONAL RANKINGS of countries’ quality of life, peace, and human development.

To find out more about what it is like to live and study in Ireland you can visit: WWW.PPI-IRLANDIA.ORG WWW.EDUCATIONINIRELAND.COM ABOUT IRELAND The higher education system in Ireland is robust, with GLOBALLY RANKED UNIVERSITIES renowned for research output. 7734 Design of A4 Brochure Ref- Why study a PhD in Ireland - Tips for Indonesian Students_v4.indd 1 09/08/2019 13:53 Ireland’s higher education system is among the best in the world, according to the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. The system is especially known for being responsive to labour market needs, ranking 1st in the world for producing graduates for a flexible and adaptable workforce, and 5th for the ability of its education system to meet the needs of a competitive economy. Over 1 in 10 full-time higher education students in Ireland are international students. Of these, three-quarters are from outside the European Union, leading to a healthy diversity of cultures on Irish University campuses. Quality assurance, QA lies at the heart of the Irish education system. All of the Irish universities have developed comprehensive internal QA procedures underpinned by the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area. There are seven universities in the Irish Universities Association (IUA).

All seven IUA member universities are placed highly in international rankings and are among the top 3% of research universities in the world in terms of research impact in major fields. EDUCATION SYSTEM ABOUT IRELAND’S Irish universities are autonomous and self-governing, and they offer degree programmes at the foundation, bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD levels. Irish Universities have dedicated international offices to help foreign students adjust to Irish academics and culture and to encourage their participation in campus clubs and societies. Ireland is at the forefront of quality PhD education in Europe, with over 6,500 researchers currently undertaking PhD education in Ireland. A PhD typically takes 4 years full-time to complete. PhD students are expected to make a substantial and original contribution to knowledge, normally leading to peer-reviewed publications. The examination for the degree of PhD is based on a description of the research written up as a thesis and defended in oral examination (“viva voce”). Over 80% of these PhD students are located in one of the seven Irish Universities Association (IUA) universities, who are committed quality provision through the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the IUA PhD Graduate Skills Statement. Most PhDs in Ireland are “structured”.

A Structured PhD enables students to achieve the best possible graduate research and training through several innovative measures designed to support students to achieve their academic and professional objectives.

This is one of the easiest things to do and earliest things you’ll want to get. If you need to buy a new phone, there are plenty of phone shops in and around the city centre, primarily located on Grafton St. If you want to keep your old phone,but set up on an Irish network, it’s as simple as popping in, and talking to them about changing over your phone. In Ireland, paying for phones comes under two categories: bill-pay and pre-pay.

If you want to avail of a bill-paying phone, you’ll need a bank account first. You’ll also be asked to set up a fixed contract, which makes this a great option for Erasmus students who may only be here for a term. Pre-pay is even easier - it gives you ‘credit’, which you can then spend on texts and calls, and you can top-up from any shop or store once you run out. Pre-pay contracts often offer deals, like free calls on evenings and weekends, or free texts to phones on the same network. The main network providers are: - meteor.ie - vodafone.ie - three.ie ## Getting Your PPS Number A PPS number serves as your tax identification number for employers.

Opening a Bank Account You must open a bank account in person in a bank branch. You are advised to open an Irish bank account after you secure accommodation in Ireland.

Bringing Money to Ireland Please bring only a small amount in Euro for your arrival. The University does not have any facilities to keep cash safe for you. You should enquire with your bank at home if you can use your debit or credit card in Ireland, as this could be a safe way to obtain cash immediately after your arrival. Once you have opened a bank account in Dublin, money can be transferred by electronic / wire transfer into your new account. Before you leave home, talk to your local bank to find out all the details about making transfers to your account in Ireland (e.g. maximum amount, how long it takes, how much it costs) so that you can plan the best system for your circumstances.

International Visa/ Debit cards often require proof of photo ID. Travellers’ cheques are not widely accepted in Ireland.

Some lecturers also teach at professional accounting level for the main professional accounting bodies. They have PhDs and are research active in UCC. Lecturers also consult for industry and publish regularly in international journals that are pertinent to industry and practice. The programme boasts relatively small class sizes (approximately 70 students). This creates a student-friendly environment in which students benefit from high levels of guidance, support and peer networking, forming an excellent foundation for the development of life skills, critical thinking, problem-solving and teamwork. The degree is designed to produce high-quality graduates equipped with skills to succeed in a variety of diverse roles while also offering a fast track to a career as a professional accountant. The programme maximises the exemptions from Professional Accounting body exams relative to other UCC undergraduate degrees (see Professional Accountancy Qualification below for more information). The majority of graduates go on to qualify as Professional Accountants and subsequently go on to pursue successful careers in diverse roles in a range of sectors. Careers include finance managers, business analysts, advisory, investment managers, risk management, business owners, teaching, as well as professional accountants.

Assurance Assoc PwC When I was in school, I was most driven in the numbers-related subjects, as most who consider a career in Accounting are. Of course, this drive comes in incredibly useful throughout this four-year degree, but the study of this degree also opens up a world beyond the numbers, a concept that I, myself, may not have considered altogether attractive before actually experiencing it. In this degree, you learn that there is so much more to accounting than the oh-so important balancing of a balance sheet or the profit or loss in a set of accounts.

There is a history to the methods you take so much for granted, a knack to the calculations you may not even fully understand yet, and a world of opportunities you may not have even considered as you didn’t realise they were even possible down the path of accountancy. Following my four years in the Accounting degree, I can confidently enter the jobs market knowing that I have the experience to back me up in any interview thanks to the six month work placement I had in my third year, and the support of a hard-earned but rewarding education in the UCC course that is highly esteemed by any employer I happen to encounter. I personally enjoy the knowledge that I have a graduate programme waiting for me after my graduation, thanks to my placement in PwC that I secured through the Accounting course’s placement co-ordinator who facilitates placement applications and interviews for Accounting students. Without the help of the accounting department’s lecturers and staff, this process would have been exponentially more difficult, and I am grateful for all the help I have been offered in this area.

Faolan Carberry – 2019 Graduate, Assurance Assoc, PwC A big advantage of the BSc Accounting degree is the smaller class sizes compared to other business courses. This results in lectures being conducted in a more friendly and open environment, where questions are encouraged. It is also much easier to make friends with classmates which is a key part of any positive college experience. If you are studying accounting for the Leaving Cert and wish to pursue accounting further, I believe the BSc Accounting degree is the best degree for you. Regardless of what professional qualification you pursue after college, no other UCC degree will provide you with as many exemptions as the BSc Accounting degree. Working and studying at the same time is challenging and the BSc Accounting degree minimises the amount of time which will have to be spent both working and studying which is a big advantage of the programme. Furthermore, the BSc Accounting degree also provides you with a substantial grounding in the topics which will be covered in the professional exams. The lecturers on the programme are experts in their field coming from a wide range of backgrounds.

Some have taught extensively on professional accountancy programmes while others have risen to top positions in the business world. This mixture of professional and educational experience leads to focused modules which are geared towards applying business concepts to practical situations. When you are in the workplace, you will need more than just academic results to succeed. You will also need excellent communication, teamwork and presentation skills and the BSc Accounting Degree provides you with plenty of opportunities to develop these skills. The six- month work placement in Third Year is also a great opportunity to gain first hand accountancy experience. Katie Crowley – 2019 Graduate, Assurance Assoc, PwC My name is Katie Crowley and I graduated from the BSc in Accounting in 2019. I thoroughly enjoyed my four years at UCC and would highly recommend the degree. Over the four years I got the opportunity to complete a variety of modules in Accounting, Economics, Management, Finance, Statistics, BIS, Law, Excel, Tax and more. As well as providing you with a rounded education of accountancy and the wider business world, you also develop many vital soft skills such as presentation, teamwork, and interview skills.

The course contains 12 hours of lectures per week plus tutorials which is very manageable. This allows plenty time to get involved in college life and join a club or society. The Accounting and Finance society organizes the annual A&F ball as well as many other events during the year. In third year, we got the chance to go on a 6-month paid placement from January to June. This was a great opportunity to get real experience in the workplace while we still had July and August to enjoy some time off before beginning final year. At the end of my 6 months in PwC they offered to sponsor me on a master’s in accounting before joining their firm to complete a three-year graduate program and qualify as a Chartered Accountant. Many people in the course secured graduate programs at the end of placement which is one thing less to worry about when entering final year. The BSc in Accounting maximises your exemptions from professional accountancy exams with ACA, CAI, CIMA, CPAI and CTA. No other UCC degree provides you with as many exemptions from professional accountancy exams.

I am going down the ACA route which involves three sets of exams, CAP1s, CAP2s and FAEs. The BSc in Accounting is the only degree at UCC which leaves you fully exempt from CAP1s which means I only had 2 sets of exams to complete after I graduated. The Chartered Accountant qualification is recognised worldwide meaning there is an opportunity to travel and work abroad as an accountant once you have qualified. Accountants are always in high demand because with every business it all comes back to the bottom line. > The biggest misconception about accounting is that it's a boring job, sometimes I wish it was boring ### Caroline Crowley, Founder CPC Outsourcing, BSc Accounting Graduate > The course offers a broad range of subjects such as Law, Economics, Marketing etc which gave me the opportunity to discover new interests. ### Tilly Downes, Associate at PwC > I'm so glad I chose to study Accounting in UCC.

It is an excellent degree for anyone who has an interest in the areas of business, accounting and finance. The degree is taught by knowledgeable lecturers, who have great expertise and experience in working in a real business environment. The 6-month work placement gave me the opportunity to put my college studies into practice. This degree has given me the opportunity to complete a Masters in Accounting and to work in globally recognised companies after college. A small class size allows for more interaction between students and lecturers. The BSc Accounting degree has given me the confidence, knowledge and experience to pursue any career in business. – Ailis McCarthy The BSc Accounting degree at UCC gave me the opportunity to work at one of the top accounting firms for 6 months. This was a very valuable experience where I got to apply my knowledge learnt through the course in everyday tasks within the firm. I really enjoyed the variety of modules covered and the strong relationship with academic staff throughout my four years at UCC. – Sarah Draper The BSC Accounting offers students an opportunity to develop key technical and analytical accounting skills.

The degree gave me the knowledge, experience and confidence to work with the largest professional services firm in the world” > The programme is an excellent stepping stone to a career in the accountancy profession, in finance or in business generally. ### Ronan O'Loughlin, Director of Education & Training, Chartered Accountants Ireland Graduates from the BSc Accounting programme in UCC have consistently performed well in the examinations of Chartered Accountants Ireland. Indeed the programme is an excellent stepping stone to a career in the accountancy profession, in finance or in business generally.

Employer feedback has been very positive since the programme’s commencement > BSc Accounting boasts a wide range of modules that allows its students flexibility in what path they want to follow. ### David Kavanagh, Corporate Finance Analyst at Deloitte Ireland - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 The BSc Accounting is an excellent springboard for students with the ambition to succeed in business. ### Breadth of subjects - Students can study law, marketing, IT, economics, statistics, management, accounting, finance, tax and auditing. ### Career preparation - Graduates are well supported and are professionally focused. - Work Experience on placement – paid work placement in 3rd year in leading Irish and International companies e.g.

However, this course offers a broad range of subjects such as Law, Economics, Marketing etc. which gave me the opportunity to discover new interests. Due to the range of subjects and areas covered, the course is an excellent base for anyone looking to enter the business world. - Tilly Downes I believe a key benefit of BSc Accounting is the invaluable opportunity of a 6-month placement with an accounting firm in my 3rd year. I came out of my placement with a far clearer view of what path I wanted to follow directly after college. Having that relevant work experience on my CV also proved a valuable advantage while interviewing for subsequent jobs. BSc Accounting boasts a wide range of modules that allows its students flexibility in what path they want to follow. The degree does not limit you to accounting but allows you to pursue a wide range of disciplines from finance to statistics to information systems - however, you can also enjoy many exemptions from the professional accounting exams.

The course also offers great support to its students. I have found the lecturers to have an open-door policy over my four years in the course and was never refused an opportunity to discuss anything to do with a module or exam. I also found tutorials to be plentiful, exam-relevant and helpful over the 4 years. I would also say the BSc Accounting course is very highly regarded and well known by employers in the industry - boasting extremely high employment rates after college, particularly with the big 4 firms. – David Kavanagh The BSc Accounting degree is a brilliant course. One of the many elements of the course which I like is the broad choice of modules. Along with the core accounting modules, students are given a wide variety of electives to choose from, such as economics, law and information systems. This allows students to develop a wider business knowledge and gives students the choice to pick modules that they enjoy. The skills and knowledge that can be gained from studying Accounting in UCC creates numerous job opportunities for students in the future. – Sinead Crowley I'm so glad I chose to study Accounting at UCC.

Students acquire commercial awareness, independent thinking and a strategic pathway to Chartered Accountancy. – Niall Galvin One of the best things about the Accounting degree in UCC was the opportunity to do the placement in 3rd year. I worked in a big accounting firm for 6 months and saw how relevant the material we study in college is when you start work. I also liked this course because of the small class sizes compared to other courses.

UCC International Office courses ## Early Start Semester in Irish Archaeology - Course Outline - Course Practicalities - Why Choose This Course - Requirements - Fees and Costs - How To Apply Updated 25 Apr 2025 Save to Favourites Share - Twitter - Facebook - Linkedin - Email - Study - International Office - Study at UCC - Visiting US and Non-EU Students - Early Start Semester in Irish Archaeology ## Course Outline The Early Start in Irish Archaeology provides students with a unique perspective on Ireland’s culture, history, and landscapes. It is equally suited to anthropology majors and students with no previous experience of archaeology or anthropology. Through illustrated lectures, class discussion, and field trips to spectacular monuments, students gain an understanding of the broad sweep of Ireland’s history from the colonisation of the island after the last Ice Age to the birth of the modern era in the seventeenth century.

We pay particular attention to key themes and subjects with contemporary resonance, including: - ongoing debates about ‘the origins of the Irish’, increasingly informed by ancient DNA - the rich archaeological evidence for interactions between locals and incomers during the Viking Age - the impact of climate change on societies in ancient Ireland - and the globally important art produced in Ireland, both during the Stone Age and in the early medieval period (e.g., the Tara brooch and the Book of Kells) Field Trips About half of the contact time is in the form of field trips designed to give students as diverse an experience of Ireland as possible. The sites visited range from fascinating local ruins off the beaten tourist trails to internationally famous archaeological complexes. In addition to several trips around Cork and neighbouring counties, we explore Dublin, Galway, and the stunning limestone landscapes of the Burren and the Aran Islands. Here, soil erosion, some of it due to human intervention, has exposed the bedrock to dramatic effect, and the stone has been used to construct iconic monuments such as the magnificent cliff-edge fort of Dún Aonghasa.

Lectures; seminars/field trips ## Course Practicalities The Early Start in Irish Archaeology runs for three weeks in late August to early September. Lectures are held in the mornings on days when no field trip is scheduled. Assessment is in the form of two projects based in part on first-hand observations by students about the many sites visited.

When the semester starts students begin other modules with their Irish counterparts. ## Why Choose This Course > A wonderful introduction to Ireland's culture, history and landscapes... ### Tomás Ó Carragáin Director, Early Start in Archaeology > The field trips were amazing because you're able to bring to life what we learned in the classroom ### Brianna Knoll Student, University of Iowa - 1 The Early Start in Irish Archaeology: - is a wonderful introduction to Ireland’s culture, history and landscapes - incorporates field trips to an unparalleled range of sites from fascinating local ruins to major complexes of international importance - gives students with no previous experience of archaeology the chance to study this exciting subject in a country with an outstanding archaeological heritage - provides anthropology and archaeology students with an engaging and challenging overview of Irish archaeology - considers aspects of Irish art and architecture and explores the role of buildings, monuments, and artefacts in the formation of Irish identities. ### Skills and Careers Information Students who take this course gain a new understanding of how people in the past, and indeed the present, use material culture (monuments and artefacts) to express social status, ideology, identity, and gender.

Ten UCC credits are awarded for the pre-session, and students may earn up to an additional 60 credits for the regular academic year. Six separate Early Start modules are offered: - Irish Archaeology - Irish Folklore and Tradition - History and Modern Ireland - Literatures in Ireland - Music in Ireland - Management and Marketing in the European Union. Visiting students can choose one of the Early Start programmes and follow an intensive pre-session three week course through mid- August into early-September. In early September, students will join their Irish counterparts and choose a selection of modules over the academic year. During the regular academic year, you may combine modules from different academic departments/schools/colleges and across different levels, from introductory (year 1) to senior level (year 4). The course allows you to be flexible in selecting modules, although certain pre-requisites may be required for admission to specific modules. In addition, you should also be aware of possible timetable conflicts when putting together your schedules.

The Early Start Semester and Full Academic Year programme at UCC provides visiting students with the opportunity to experience a different academic environment and to immerse themselves in Irish culture At the end of the course, students will have gained an insight into Ireland, past and present, and will have had the opportunity to develop, both personally and academically. ## Requirements Students are normally required to have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 out of 4.0. ## Fees and Costs Please refer to our section 'What will it cost?' on ourVisiting Student Website ## How To Apply SeeVisiting US and Non-EU Studentsfor details on how to apply Please note that in the case of other programmes offering study options at UCC (e.g. Centre for Study Abroad, Arcadia University, Institute for Study Abroad, Butler University, InterStudy and USAC ), different procedures and deadlines may apply.

The following are accepted: á; é; í; ó; ú; Á; É; Í; Ó; and Ú. Some help tips are available when you are giving the details which will explain what information is needed. ## First online page Once you visithttps://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspxyou are presented with a “Welcome” message and you must click “Continue” (highlighted by the red box in the below image) in order to move to the next screen. ## General information page After clicking “Continue” you will be brought to an information page. Please read this page carefully and visit the links provided on this page. Before you can begin to give your details, you must have read ourTerms and Conditionsand ourPrivacy Statement. You will need to confirm having read the documentation, by ticking the box, before you can start to complete your details.

After you have read and understood the “Privacy Notice” tick the box (highlighted by the blue box in the below image) and then clicking “AVATS Online Application Form” (highlighted by the green box in the below image). ## Warning about false or misleading information Please be aware that if you give false, fraudulent, or misleading information or documentation: - Your application may be refused; and - You may not be allowed to appeal that decision; and - You may be prevented from making any other Irish visa or preclearance application for up to five years from the date of our decision. ## Moving between pages After each page of details provided you can advance to the next screen by clicking “Save And Continue” (highlighted by the green box in the below image). You can go back to the previous page by clicking “Back” (highlighted by the orange box in the below image). These will be on the top and bottom of each screen. You will not be able to move from a page until you have provided an answer to each required question on the current page.

You will not be able to move from a page if the information you have provided is invalid, for example invalid characters, or a date in the future which must be in the past. If you have not given details for any needed answer, a message will appear at the top of the screen. You need to scroll down the screen to complete the missing details (or to see details which are not permitted by the system). ## Information needed to be given by you Information which must be given by you is indicated by a red asterisk (*). In this document we will assume that all information is needed unless it is stated to be optional. ## Nationality The first question is your nationality. Pick the country for which you hold a passport. If you have dual nationality you should pick the country which issued the passport on which you intend to travel. If you have a Travel Document issued under the 1951 Convention (refugee) you should pick “Stateless”. The answer to this question will decide the types of applications that the system will make available to you in the ‘Reason for Travel’ question.

If the nationality is not a visa-required nationality then you will be offered the preclearance application categories to pick from (visa application categories will not be offered to you). If the nationality is transit-visa-required nationality then you will be offered all visa application categories to pick from (preclearance application categories will not be offered to you). If the nationality is visa-required and not transit-visa-required then you will be offered all visa application categories to pick from, except for transit visa (preclearance application categories will not be offered to you). ## Reason for Travel You then need to pick the ‘Reason for Travel’. The choice you make will decide the questions which you will need to answer throughout the remainder of the process so it is important that you pick the correct reason from the list. Bear in mind that the nationality you picked in the first question will have narrowed down the type of application offered to you for this answer.

If your reason for travel is not shown in this list you should pick “Other”. “Other” is not offered to those nationalities who are not visa-required as every occasion where preclearance is needed is included in the list. ## Type of Visa or Preclearance Your answer to the ‘Reason for Travel’ question will, sometimes, decide what type of application you will be applying for. The system will, in those cases, pick that answer for you and you will not be able to change that answer. Some examples: - A ‘visit visa’ must be a short stay application and system picks “Short Stay C”; A ‘visit visa’ must be a short stay application and system picks “Short Stay C”; - A ‘Join Family’ application must be a long stay application and the system picks “Long Stay D”. A ‘Join Family’ application must be a long stay application and the system picks “Long Stay D”. If you picked a ‘Reason for Travel’ which can be either long-stay or short-stay (for example ‘Employment’) then you need to pick the type of visa you are applying for – “Short Stay (C)” or “Long Stay (D)”.

A Short Stay (C) application is for a proposed stay in Ireland of 90 days or less. A Long Stay (D) is for a proposed stay of more than 90 days. The exception to this is a visa application under the ‘Free Movement Directive’ which are all “Short Stay (C)” including where you intend to stay in Ireland for longer than 90 days. All preclearance applications are Long Stay (D). ## Single or Multiple Journey Visa The next question you will be asked is ‘Journey Type’. Pick “Single” or “Multiple” as appropriate. A Single Journey visa will allow you to travel to Ireland only one time while the visa is valid. A Multiple Journey visa will allow you to travel to Ireland a number of times while the visa is valid. The application fee for “Multiple” is higher than for “Single”. If you apply for “Multiple” and we grant a “Single” then we will not refund the difference in the application fees. Further information on Single and Multi-entry visas is available by visiting For preclearance applicants, a “Multiple” gives no advantage to the applicant.

For this reason, the system picks “Single” for all preclearance applications to avoid the higher application fee for “Multiple”. ## Purpose of Travel This answer is optional and you may give additional relevant information. Giving additional relevant information is very important if you pick “Other” as the ‘Reason for Travel’. ## Passport Details Pick the Type of Passport you will use (most people will hold a National Passport) and give the Passport Number. ## Proposed Dates Give the dates on which you intend to enter into and leave from Ireland. If you are applying for a long-term visa or preclearance, you may leave the ‘To’ answer blank. Leaving the ‘To’ answer blank will also apply where the application is being made under the ‘Free Movement Directive’ (Reason for Travel” – “Family member of EU/EEA/Swiss cit….”) and the intention is to stay in Ireland for more than 90 days.

Applicants for all other ‘Short stay C’ must enter their proposed date of leaving Ireland in this answer (for a multi-entry application you should enter the intended date of leaving Ireland on your first trip). ## Personal details Next you must enter your Surname (family name), Forename, and any other name(s) (e.g. maiden name or name at birth). These will be as they appear on your passport. If you only have a surname or first name on your passport then, as you must give an answer to each of these questions, give “.” as the reply to the appropriate question which would otherwise be blank and not permitted by the system. Your Date of Birth must be in the format ddmmyyyy – e.g. 07091982 – 7th September 1982. Pick your gender by clicking the appropriate choice. Pick your Country of Birth from the list. For current location you pick the country where you are currently living. “Ireland” is not on the list. A visa or preclearance is needed to travel to Ireland and you cannot make that application when you are already in Ireland. Your full address is needed (a Post Office Box address is not accepted).

Your current address is needed here and you may use up to 4 lines to enter details. Give a telephone number at which the Deciding Officer can contact you during daytime working hours, and your email address. ## Application Number You will then be presented with a new page with your unique application number. This application number will be eight digits long and will be in red e.g. 98765432 (see example highlighted by green box in Image 4). Make a note of this number as you will need it. Once you have this number you can save your details and return to complete your details within 30 days. You can also continue giving your details. The remaining questions that you will be asked will depend on the answer you have given to the ‘Reason for travel’ near the start of giving your details. The remaining questions will, in general, relate to your past immigration history, your current occupation (if any), details of your host/family member in Ireland, your personal status and family details. Some questions are compulsory and you will not be able to continue giving the details until you have answered these questions.

Many questions will give you the choice of answering ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. When you pick one of these choices, further questions may be asked of you. You will not be able to see these further questions until you have answered the relevant question. It is very important that you always pick the correct answer as an incorrect answer may mean that you miss out on giving vital information. The missing out on giving this information could: - Delay the processing of your application; and - Result in the application being refused. The following covers the questions that relate to most applications. ## Biometric information This question is posed in the middle of the Immigration History and Criminal record section and is out of the sequence you may find it when giving your details. You may have to give your biometric information – your fingerprints and live capture facial image (in other words a digital photograph) – as part of the application process.

The giving of biometric information depends on the country where you are currently living and you will not be asked this question if the country you have given earlier in the form is not a country where biometric information is needed for an Irish visa application. “Are you exempt from the requirement to provide biometrics?” Pick “Yes” or “No” as appropriate. If you pick “Yes” you will be asked for the basis of the exemption and pick the one which applies to you. An incorrect claim to be exempt from giving biometric information (see list below) may result in: - Your application may be refused; and - You may not be allowed to appeal that decision; and - You may be prevented from making any other Irish visa or preclearance application for up to five years from the date of our decision. ## Exemptions from giving biometric information 1. Children under five years of age on the date of the giving of their application details. 2. Heads of State and the members of their family forming part of their household whether travelling officially or privately and private servants and officials included in the delegations of such visitors.

Members of their household include spouse, civil partner, and children under 18 years. 6. Diplomatic couriers travelling to the State or transiting the State. 7.

Diplomats travelling to the State in their official capacity as part of the official party or delegation of serving Government Ministers (or equivalent) are exempt where their applications are accompanied by a note verbale from the sending authority (i.e. the relevant government department setting out the details of the nature of the visit and who is travelling) and an invitation letter from the inviting department in Ireland. 8. (a) Employees of intergovernmental organisations based, or with offices, in Ireland who have been recruited overseas,(b) representatives and officials of intergovernmental organisations travelling to Ireland in their official capacity on the official business of that organisation. The applications must be accompanied by a note from the intergovernmental organisation setting out the details and nature of the visit and an invitation letter from the inviting organisation in Ireland. Members of their family forming part of their household are exempt. Members of their household include spouse, civil partner, children under 18 years of age.

The UK has moved to issuing Electronic Travel Authorisations (ETAs) for a number of countries in lieu of visas. Please note that an ETA cannot be used to avail of the SSVWP, any National in possession of an ETA and not a UK Visa will need a separate Irish visa if they wish to travel to the State. and - Does your visit to Ireland end before your permission to stay in UK ends (this is granted by an UK immigration official when you pass through UK immigration)? and - Was your passport issued by one of the countries listed in the list below? You do not need a visa if you are a British citizen.

For further information please visit the following link: The Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee TD has announced theimmediate lifting of entry visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals– Immigration Service Delivery (irishimmigration.ie). ## UK short stay visas UK short stay visit visas are permittedexceptthose issued for: - Visitors in transit - Visitors seeking to marry or to enter a civil partnership. Long term visitors to the UK are not allowed, for example: - Long term student visas - Persons seeking to join a spouse or for family reunification. ## How to use the visa waiver programme In order to avail of the programme you must have landed and gained lawful entry to the UK on foot of your current UK visa, prior to undertaking the journey to Ireland. Each distinct period of leave to remain in the UK (up to a maximum of 180 days each time) requires a prior legal entry into the UK before travel to Ireland under the programme, no matter what the duration of the UK visa. This programme is not reciprocal. It does not permit a person who is a visa required national under UK immigration rules to enter the UK on foot of an Irish visa.

However, if you have already been to the UK and then travelled home,but still have time remaining on your UK permission, then you can travel directly to Ireland provided the visit is within remaining time on your UK permission. ## How long can I stay in Ireland? Your journey to Ireland must take place within the dates of your permission to be in the UK. The maximum amount of time you can come to Ireland for under the programme is for 90 days, or the remaining time left on you UK permission, whichever is the least amount of time.

So, as an example, if someone has permission to be in the UK for 180 days and they have already been there for 160 out of those 180 days, then the most amount of time they can be allowed into Ireland for is 20 days, not 90. (i.e. 180 days – 160 days = 20 days remaining on their UK permission.) Similarly, if someone has permission to be in the UK for 180 days and they have already been there for 30 out of those 180 days, then the most amount of time they can be allowed to stay in Ireland for is still 90 days, not 150. (Although there are 150 days remaining on the UK permission, the most amount of time someone can come to Ireland for is 90 days). ## Contact Us Immigration Service DeliveryDepartment of Justice,Home Affairs and Migration13-14 Burgh QuayDublin 2 D02 XK70Ireland ## Our Location ## Useful Links -

If you wish to stay on as a student after that time you must enrol on a higher education programme listed on the ILEP. ## What are the attendance requirements for a student studying English language full-time? ## What are the requirements of providers included on the ILEP? - Refunding fees and charges - Monitoring class attendance and punctuality - Dealing with absenteeism and expulsion - Student sick leave - Student holidays and breaks - Registering students for end of programme exams - Student assessments and exams All colleges must provide learner protection for students. This protects you if your programme ceases prematurely. This could mean you complete the programme with another provider, or you are given a refund of a portion of your fees.

Your letter of acceptance from the provider must clearly state that you are covered by learner protection arrangements. If the learner protection arrangements are through an insurance scheme, the provider must give you a certificate of proof in your name demonstrating that you are covered. This certificate shows you what to do if you need to make a claim. Providers must also publish the names of the recruitment agents they deal with. Before making a decision, you should assess what is on offer, the reputation of the institution and its facilities. The lowest price may not be the best deal. A provider must list all costs in advance, including exam fees and cannot accept fees in cash. You should research the provider and programme before enrolling or transferring any money to a provider or an agent. ## What are the holiday arrangements for full-time non-EEA students on English language programmes?

Or - Where a student is not part of a Group Insurance Scheme operated by their college then they are required to have individual private medical insurance coverage bought in Ireland. Or For newly arrived first year students in Ireland Travel insurance may suffice where: - The insurance covers the student for one full year or where the student is staying in Ireland for less than one year for the entirety of their stay - The insurance coverage covers the student at a minimum of €25,000 for accident and €25,000 for disease - The insurance coverage covers the student for any period of hospitalisation. Where a non-EEA student intends staying in Ireland for more than one year, and where they were covered by travel insurance for the first year, that student is required to source private medical insurance for their second and any subsequent years. ## Second and Subsequent Registration All non-EEA students are required to provide evidence that they are in receipt of private medical insurance and that they maintained private medical insurance for the previous registration period at second and subsequent registration. This can be done by way of a letter of renewal for example.

This could mean you complete the programme/course with another provider, or have a portion of your fees and costs refunded as part of an insurance scheme.Your acceptance letter from the provider must clearly state the type of learner protection arrangements. If the learner protection arrangements are through an insurance scheme, you must be provided with a policy certificate in your own name proving that you are covered. This certificate must also include contact details for the insurer and details of how to make a claim.The certificate may be emailed to you by the insurer and you should receive it after you pay your fees.

TheThird Level Graduate Programmeallows legally resident Irish educated non-EEA graduates who hold a level 8 or level 9 award from a recognised Irish awarding body to remain in Ireland after their studies for a period of twelve months. ## Contact Us Immigration Service DeliveryDepartment of Justice,Home Affairs and Migration13-14 Burgh QuayDublin 2 D02 XK70Ireland ## Our Location ## Useful Links - Privacy Policy and Cookies - Accessibility - Disclaimer - Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) Online – Terms and Conditions - Immigration Legislation and Policy Guidelines - Freedom of Information (FOI) - Protecting Personal Data in the Department of Justice - Sitemap ### Important information for non-EEA national student immigration permission – September 2023 The policy and guidelines for immigration permission for non-EEA national students are set out in detail on this website. - https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/frequently-asked-questions-for-students/ - https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/ - https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-study-options/a-third-level-course-or-a-language-course/ These guidelines and policies have been updated over the years and the current up to date position for non EEA national students is available on our website. The website sets out what we refer to as The Student Pathway. The Student Pathway is as follows: 1.

The non-EEA national student takes up an English language course or higher education programme that is listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP). The non-EEA national student is registered on Stamp 2 student conditions and has concession to work 20 hours per week (without an employment permit) during term-time and 40 hours per week during vacation time. Vacation times June, July, August and September, and between 15 December and 15 January. 2. The maximum time a person can do English language courses is two years. This consists of three courses of eight months each. English language students are then required to undertake a higher education programme listed on the ILEP to qualify for further immigration permission as a non-EEA national student. 3. The Third Level Graduate Programme allows graduates with a level eight (8) qualification (awarded in Ireland) to get a 12-month extension to their residence permission on Stamp 1G, provided the number of years spend on the student pathway (stamps 2,2A, 1A, 1G) do not exceed seven (7) years in total.

Graduates with qualifications at level nine (9) or above may get a 24-month extension (two blocks of 12-months) to their permission provided the number of years spent on the student pathway (stamps 2, 2A, 1A, 1G) does not exceed 8 years in total. 4. The Third Level Graduate Programme gives a permission on Stamp 1G. This is for the purpose of seeking graduate level employment and applying for a general employment permit, a critical skills employment permit or research hosting agreement. This time is given to allow graduates to work 40 hours a week without an employment permit and seek an employment permit based job. 5. When graduates get an Employment Permit issued by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment they can then register on Stamp 1 conditions. If a graduate does not get an employment permit, or does not apply for and qualify for another immigration permission, before the end of their Stamp 1G student permission they will be expected to leave the State. The Domestic Residence and Permission Division (DRP) has recently been receiving a high level of applications and queries regarding conditions for Non-EEA national students.

At the end of two (2) years the student is required to progress onto a higher education programme in order to qualify for further immigration permission as a non-EEA national student. - The first port of call for any non-EEA national student who has difficulties or queries is their local immigration office. - When a graduate is on a Stamp 1G it is expected that they, or their employer, will apply for and obtain an employment permit before the end of the permission. It is not generally permissible to extend immigration permission in order to facilitate a late application for an employment permit. - If a non-EEA national student is refused registration at their local immigration office and they believe there are exceptional circumstances in their case it is then open to them to make anapplicationto DRP. Over the course of the past three years certain concessions have been afforded to non-EEA national students in the State. During the pandemic, the Minister extended all immigration permissions nine times to allow people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 to be legally permitted to remain here until 31 May 2022.

These extensions were made in the context of an uncertain health and international travel situation to provide assistance and assurance to people who use the immigration services. In addition during the pandemic and in recognition of the difficulties graduates faced in accessing employment opportunities DRP extended Graduate permissions (Stamp 1G) for many graduates on request.

The governing bodies included in these arrangements for the contracting of trainee accountants for qualifying as an accountant in Ireland are the Institute of Certified Public Accountants Ireland (CPA), the Association of Chartered Accountants Ireland (ACI) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants Ireland (ACCA). This arrangement is separate from any other training schemes or programmes, which these organisations may operate that lead to qualification as a professional accountant. ## Eligibility The eligibility conditions attaching to the granting of a Stamp 1A for Trainee Accountants have been updated due to demand led requirements to allow non-EEA nationals who have already obtained a Third Level Degree Qualification in any discipline, either in Ireland or internationally to acquire a recognised accountancy qualification. ## Trainee requirements In order that the integrity of the scheme is maintained only students with a third level degree qualification will be permitted to make an application for this programme In order to be considered a qualifying trainee you must have a level of competency with proven certification in order that those offering you a registration and training contract can establish that you have the potential to complete the necessary examinations and training required.

As accountancy bodies are international it is open to students who fail to complete their qualification in Ireland during the four year time limit permitted and where the overall limit of eight years as a student or trainee has expired, to seek to do so in another jurisdiction. If sufficient progression is not made as per the conditions of the training contract or if the training contract is withdrawn for any reason the Stamp 1A permission will lapse and the trainee will be obliged to leave the State. It is not open to the trainee to change employer or amend the contract provisions unless in very exceptional circumstances and agreed with Immigration Service Delivery. Such request will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The permission granted under this arrangement, Stamp 1A, is only granted to trainees who are contracted in full time paid accountancy training and where the accountancy practice or business is registered with a Professional Accountancy Body. The Stamp 1A granted does not permit the holder to work in any other business or employment in the State.

Successful completion of the training contract and the subsequent membership of the Accountancy body must qualify the applicant for a practice certificate for Ireland. A professional accountant must supervise the students’ training. When renewing the Stamp 1A permission, required on an annual basis, the trainee must present a progression report by the Accountancy Practice or Business, training supervisor, confirming exams passed and experience gained in the previous 12 months. Failure to supply this information will result in the application for renewal being refused. Currently some of the Accountancy Bodies provide a spreadsheet to the ISD Registration Office detailing this information and this practice should continue. ISD requests that those bodies not currently supplying a spreadsheet should commence with the details of the current trainee intake. It should also be noted that the arrangements set out here reflect the current immigration policy. Immigration policies are kept under ongoing review and are subject to change from time to time. Please visit www.irishimmigration.ie for up to date information.

A four year period is considered sufficient for students to complete their professional accounting qualifications. However, recognising that following completion of their training, a newly qualified accountant will have to complete certain membership formalities with their accountancy body and also apply for an employment permit if they want to remain and work in the State, an extension of six months is permissible at the end of the four year period, therefore, bringing the overall maximum up to four years and six months. Note: The six-month extension is not provided for a trainee to re-sit exams. Where the trainee accountant has completed their undergraduate degree programme in Ireland a maximum permitted time in the State, of eight years, including time spent as a student on Stamp 2, 2A or 1G conditions, will apply with a maximum of four years on Stamp 1A conditions being permitted. Where the applicant relies on an internationally awarded undergraduate or postgraduate degree and has not previously resided in Ireland as a student on Stamp 2 2A or 1G conditions then a maximum of 4 years on Stamp 1A conditions will apply.
