## Introduction

This is a guide to giving your details for a visa or preclearance application to travel to Ireland onwww.visas.inis.gov.ie.  “Applicant” is the person who is applying for a visa or preclearance.  Where the applicant is under 18 years of age, the application details must be completed by the applicant’s parent (or legal guardian).  This will be the same person who will sign the Application Form which is produced by the system when the details have been completed.  “you” and “your” are used in this page to mean the applicant.

## Before you start

Before you give your details for your application you should read the information, relevant to the application you wish make, on our website –irishimmigration.ie.

Our website gives a comprehensive list of supporting documentation you will need and a Deciding Officer may request additional documents where necessary. If you are applying to one of our Visa Offices in Abu Dhabi, Abuja, Ankara, Beijing, London, Moscow, or New Delhi you are advised to also check their websites for details of any further documentation which may be needed by those offices. Contact details can be found onwww.dfa.ie.

Please ensure you have all your supporting documentation ready for submission prior to giving your details online.

The online visa application facility can be found at the following link:https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx.

The visa application facility is only available is only available in English and all questions must be answered in English. You can only use standard English language characters and any accented letters or non-English characters (e.g. ñ, ÿ, Ø, ç, ß) are not accepted. The following are accepted: á; é; í; ó; ú; Á; É; Í; Ó; and Ú. Some help tips are available when you are giving the details which will explain what information is needed.

## First online page

Once you visithttps://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspxyou are presented with a “Welcome” message and you must click “Continue” (highlighted by the red box in the below image) in order to move to the next screen.

## General information page

After clicking “Continue” you will be brought to an information page. Please read this page carefully and visit the links provided on this page. Before you can begin to give your details, you must have read ourTerms and Conditionsand ourPrivacy Statement. You will need to confirm having read the documentation, by ticking the box, before you can start to complete your details. After you have read and understood the “Privacy Notice” tick the box (highlighted by the blue box in the below image) and then clicking “AVATS Online Application Form” (highlighted by the green box in the below image).

## Warning about false or misleading information

Please be aware that if you give false, fraudulent, or misleading information or documentation:

- Your application may be refused; and

- You may not be allowed to appeal that decision; and

- You may be prevented from making any other Irish visa or preclearance application for up to five years from the date of our decision.

## Moving between pages

After each page of details provided you can advance to the next screen by clicking “Save And Continue” (highlighted by the green box in the below image). You can go back to the previous page by clicking “Back” (highlighted by the orange box in the below image). These will be on the top and bottom of each screen.

You will not be able to move from a page until you have provided an answer to each required question on the current page. You will not be able to move from a page if the information you have provided is invalid, for example invalid characters, or a date in the future which must be in the past. If you have not given details for any needed answer, a message will appear at the top of the screen. You need to scroll down the screen to complete the missing details (or to see details which are not permitted by the system).

## Information needed to be given by you

Information which must be given by you is indicated by a red asterisk (*). In this document we will assume that all information is needed unless it is stated to be optional.

## Nationality

The first question is your nationality. Pick the country for which you hold a passport. If you have dual nationality you should pick the country which issued the passport on which you intend to travel. If you have a Travel Document issued under the 1951 Convention (refugee) you should pick “Stateless”.

The answer to this question will decide the types of applications that the system will make available to you in the ‘Reason for Travel’ question.

If the nationality is not a visa-required nationality then you will be offered the preclearance application categories to pick from (visa application categories will not be offered to you).

If the nationality is transit-visa-required nationality then you will be offered all visa application categories to pick from (preclearance application categories will not be offered to you).

If the nationality is visa-required and not transit-visa-required then you will be offered all visa application categories to pick from, except for transit visa (preclearance application categories will not be offered to you).

## Reason for Travel

You then need to pick the ‘Reason for Travel’. The choice you make will decide the questions which you will need to answer throughout the remainder of the process so it is important that you pick the correct reason from the list. Bear in mind that the nationality you picked in the first question will have narrowed down the type of application offered to you for this answer.

If your reason for travel is not shown in this list you should pick “Other”. “Other” is not offered to those nationalities who are not visa-required as every occasion where preclearance is needed is included in the list.

## Type of Visa or Preclearance

Your answer to the ‘Reason for Travel’ question will, sometimes, decide what type of application you will be applying for. The system will, in those cases, pick that answer for you and you will not be able to change that answer. Some examples:

- A ‘visit visa’ must be a short stay application and system picks “Short Stay C”;

A ‘visit visa’ must be a short stay application and system picks “Short Stay C”;

- A ‘Join Family’ application must be a long stay application and the system picks “Long Stay D”.

A ‘Join Family’ application must be a long stay application and the system picks “Long Stay D”.

If you picked a ‘Reason for Travel’ which can be either long-stay or short-stay (for example ‘Employment’) then you need to pick the type of visa you are applying for – “Short Stay (C)” or “Long Stay (D)”.

A Short Stay (C) application is for a proposed stay in Ireland of 90 days or less.

A Long Stay (D) is for a proposed stay of more than 90 days. The exception to this is a visa application under the ‘Free Movement Directive’ which are all “Short Stay (C)” including where you intend to stay in Ireland for longer than 90 days.

All preclearance applications are Long Stay (D).

## Single or Multiple Journey Visa

The next question you will be asked is ‘Journey Type’. Pick “Single” or “Multiple” as appropriate.

A Single Journey visa will allow you to travel to Ireland only one time while the visa is valid.

A Multiple Journey visa will allow you to travel to Ireland a number of times while the visa is valid.

The application fee for “Multiple” is higher than for “Single”. If you apply for “Multiple” and we grant a “Single” then we will not refund the difference in the application fees. Further information on Single and Multi-entry visas is available by visiting

For preclearance applicants, a “Multiple” gives no advantage to the applicant. For this reason, the system picks “Single” for all preclearance applications to avoid the higher application fee for “Multiple”.

## Purpose of Travel

This answer is optional and you may give additional relevant information. Giving additional relevant information is very important if you pick “Other” as the ‘Reason for Travel’.

## Passport Details

Pick the Type of Passport you will use (most people will hold a National Passport) and give the Passport Number.

## Proposed Dates

Give the dates on which you intend to enter into and leave from Ireland. If you are applying for a long-term visa or preclearance, you may leave the ‘To’ answer blank. Leaving the ‘To’ answer blank will also apply where the application is being made under the ‘Free Movement Directive’ (Reason for Travel” – “Family member of EU/EEA/Swiss cit….”) and the intention is to stay in Ireland for more than 90 days. Applicants for all other ‘Short stay C’ must enter their proposed date of leaving Ireland in this answer (for a multi-entry application you should enter the intended date of leaving Ireland on your first trip).

## Personal details

Next you must enter your Surname (family name), Forename, and any other name(s) (e.g. maiden name or name at birth). These will be as they appear on your passport. If you only have a surname or first name on your passport then, as you must give an answer to each of these questions, give “.” as the reply to the appropriate question which would otherwise be blank and not permitted by the system.

Your Date of Birth must be in the format ddmmyyyy – e.g. 07091982 – 7th September 1982.

Pick your gender by clicking the appropriate choice.

Pick your Country of Birth from the list.

For current location you pick the country where you are currently living. “Ireland” is not on the list. A visa or preclearance is needed to travel to Ireland and you cannot make that application when you are already in Ireland.

Your full address is needed (a Post Office Box address is not accepted). Your current address is needed here and you may use up to 4 lines to enter details.

Give a telephone number at which the Deciding Officer can contact you during daytime working hours, and your email address.

## Application Number

You will then be presented with a new page with your unique application number. This application number will be eight digits long and will be in red e.g. 98765432 (see example highlighted by green box in Image 4). Make a note of this number as you will need it. Once you have this number you can save your details and return to complete your details within 30 days. You can also continue giving your details.

The remaining questions that you will be asked will depend on the answer you have given to the ‘Reason for travel’ near the start of giving your details. The remaining questions will, in general, relate to your past immigration history, your current occupation (if any), details of your host/family member in Ireland, your personal status and family details. Some questions are compulsory and you will not be able to continue giving the details until you have answered these questions.

Many questions will give you the choice of answering ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. When you pick one of these choices, further questions may be asked of you. You will not be able to see these further questions until you have answered the relevant question. It is very important that you always pick the correct answer as an incorrect answer may mean that you miss out on giving vital information. The missing out on giving this information could:

- Delay the processing of your application; and

- Result in the application being refused.

The following covers the questions that relate to most applications.

## Biometric information

This question is posed in the middle of the Immigration History and Criminal record section and is out of the sequence you may find it when giving your details. You may have to give your biometric information – your fingerprints and live capture facial image (in other words a digital photograph) – as part of the application process. The giving of biometric information depends on the country where you are currently living and you will not be asked this question if the country you have given earlier in the form is not a country where biometric information is needed for an Irish visa application.

“Are you exempt from the requirement to provide biometrics?” Pick “Yes” or “No” as appropriate.

If you pick “Yes” you will be asked for the basis of the exemption and pick the one which applies to you.

An incorrect claim to be exempt from giving biometric information (see list below) may result in:

- Your application may be refused; and

- You may not be allowed to appeal that decision; and

- You may be prevented from making any other Irish visa or preclearance application for up to five years from the date of our decision.

## Exemptions from giving biometric information

1. Children under five years of age on the date of the giving of their application details.

2. Heads of State and the members of their family forming part of their household whether travelling officially or privately and private servants and officials included in the delegations of such visitors. Members of their household include spouse, civil partner, children under 18 years of age.

6. Diplomatic couriers travelling to the State or transiting the State.

7. Diplomats travelling to the State in their official capacity as part of the official party or delegation of serving Government Ministers (or equivalent) are exempt where their applications are accompanied by a note verbale from the sending authority (i.e. the relevant government department setting out the details of the nature of the visit and who is travelling) and an invitation letter from the inviting department in Ireland.

8. (a) Employees of intergovernmental organisations based, or with offices, in Ireland who have been recruited overseas,(b) representatives and officials of intergovernmental organisations travelling to Ireland in their official capacity on the official business of that organisation.
