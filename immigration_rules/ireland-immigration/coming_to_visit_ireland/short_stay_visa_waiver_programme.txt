- Short stay visa waiver programme

## In This Section

IntroductionWho is eligibleEligible countriesUK short stay visas

How to use the visa waiver programmeWhat if I come from an eligible country, but I have a long-stay permission to live in the UKCan I travel directly to Ireland on my valid UK Short-Stay Visa?How long can I stay in Ireland?

## Introduction

TheShort-Stay Visa Waiver Programmeallows nationals of certain countries, who have entered the UK on foot of certain UK short stay visas, to travel to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa. They instead may use the time remaining on their current leave to remain in the UK. This programme is subject to the conditions outlined below.

## Who is eligible

You may be able to visit Ireland, for less than 90 days, without an Irish visa if you can answer “yes” to each of these questions:

- Do you have an eligible UK short stay visa?

The UK has moved to issuing Electronic Travel Authorisations (ETAs) for a number of countries in lieu of visas. Please note that an ETA cannot be used to avail of the SSVWP, any National in possession of an ETA and not a UK Visa will need a separate Irish visa if they wish to travel to the State.

and

- Does your visit to Ireland end before your permission to stay in UK ends (this is granted by an UK immigration official when you pass through UK immigration)?

and

- Was your passport issued by one of the countries listed in the list below?

You do not need a visa if you are a British citizen. Check if you need a visa for Ireland.

## Eligible Countries

### Note 1: China

In the case ofChina, nationals of the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau are already on the list of those nationals who do not require a visa to travel to Ireland.

### Note 2: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Peru

In the case of nationals from theSaudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Peru, the United Kingdom(UK) Electronic Travel Authorisation cannot be used to travel to Ireland.

Only those who enter the UK with an existing valid short-stay UK visa issued before the introduction of the ETA on 1 February 2024, including a multi-entry UK visa, are able to avail of the Short Stay Visa Waiver Scheme to travel to Ireland.

### Note 3: Ukraine

As per the Minister for Justice’s announcement on 25 February 2022, citizens of Ukraine do not need a visa to travel to Ireland. For further information please visit the following link: The Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee TD has announced theimmediate lifting of entry visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals– Immigration Service Delivery (irishimmigration.ie).

## UK short stay visas

UK short stay visit visas are permittedexceptthose issued for:

- Visitors in transit

- Visitors seeking to marry or to enter a civil partnership.

Long term visitors to the UK are not allowed, for example:

- Long term student visas

- Persons seeking to join a spouse or for family reunification.

## How to use the visa waiver programme

In order to avail of the programme you must have landed and gained lawful entry to the UK on foot of your current UK visa, prior to undertaking the journey to Ireland.

Each distinct period of leave to remain in the UK (up to a maximum of 180 days each time) requires a prior legal entry into the UK before travel to Ireland under the programme, no matter what the duration of the UK visa.

This programme is not reciprocal. It does not permit a person who is a visa required national under UK immigration rules to enter the UK on foot of an Irish visa. If you wish to enter the UK (including Northern Ireland), you must be in possession of a valid UK visa.

## What if I come from an eligible country, but I have a long-stay permission to live in the UK?

You must have a valid UK short-stay (“C”) visa in order to travel to Ireland from the UK under this programme.

If you have any other form of permission to live in the U.K., (e.g. another type of UK “D” visa or a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) card), then you will need to apply for a visa to travel to Ireland. More information on how to apply for a visa can be found herewww.irishimmigration.ie.

Although you will be required to apply for a visa, you will not have to pay a visa fee as you are from an eligible country and are a long-term legal resident of the UK.

## Can I travel directly to Ireland on my valid UK Short-Stay Visa?

No. You must first land and be granted permission to stay in the UK before travelling to Ireland.

However, if you have already been to the UK and then travelled home,but still have time remaining on your UK permission, then you can travel directly to Ireland provided the visit is within remaining time on your UK permission.

## How long can I stay in Ireland?

Your journey to Ireland must take place within the dates of your permission to be in the UK.

The maximum amount of time you can come to Ireland for under the programme is for 90 days, or the remaining time left on you UK permission, whichever is the least amount of time.

So, as an example, if someone has permission to be in the UK for 180 days and they have already been there for 160 out of those 180 days, then the most amount of time they can be allowed into Ireland for is 20 days, not 90. (i.e. 180 days – 160 days = 20 days remaining on their UK permission.)

Similarly, if someone has permission to be in the UK for 180 days and they have already been there for 30 out of those 180 days, then the most amount of time they can be allowed to stay in Ireland for is still 90 days, not 150. (Although there are 150 days remaining on the UK permission, the most amount of time someone can come to Ireland for is 90 days).
