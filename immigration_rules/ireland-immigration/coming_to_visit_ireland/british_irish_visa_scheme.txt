## Further information

### Availing of British Irish Visa Scheme

If you are availing of the British Irish Visa Scheme, and have a visa endorsed‘BIVS’, you must first travel to the country that issued the visa. In other words, if you have an Irish short stay visa and want to also visit the UK for a short stay, you must travel to Ireland first. If you have a British visitor visa and want to also visit Ireland, you must travel to the UK first.

### Single entry visas

A single entry‘BIVS’endorsed visa means a single entry to the CTA. You may travel a number of times between Ireland and the UK on a single journey to the CTA. While you are required to enter the country which issued the visa first, you can leave the CTA from either country.

### Multiple entry visas

(a) Irish visa schemeYou will have to enter Ireland first. Once you leave the CTA, the next time you enter the CTA you must arrive in Ireland first. The duration of your stay in Ireland will be decided by the Irish immigration officer and placed on a stamp in your passport. The duration of stay which may be granted is up to 90 days.

(b) UK visa schemeFor example, if you have entered the UK or have been granted leave to enter the UK by a UK immigration official (for up to 180 days) using this visa and your intended visit to Ireland ends before your leave to remain in the UK ends, you may be permitted to travel directly to Ireland from a 3rd country without arriving into the UK again.

The duration of stay in Ireland may be up to 90 days or to the end of the UK permission, whichever is the shorter period. An immigration officer decides how long you can stay in Ireland.

Important

An eligible visa (British or Irish) under this programme will only allow you to travel to Ireland to visit for up to 90 days, it does not guarantee entry into Ireland.

If you arrive via the border with Northern Ireland, you must report to an Immigration Officer at the Dundalk Immigration Office, a port of entry at Dublin Airport or Port, or a localGarda Síochána (police) immigration officewithin 30 days of your arrival, or within 7 days if you are engaging in business or employment.

The maximum permitted stay in Ireland is up to 90 days or to the end of the UK permission, whichever is the shorter period.

You can visit as many times as you like, within the permitted duration of stay as decided by  the Irish immigration officer when you first arrive. Your permitted duration of stay will be  stamped on your passport when you first arrive.When you apply for an Irish visa, you will  need to demonstrate that Ireland is your primary destination.
