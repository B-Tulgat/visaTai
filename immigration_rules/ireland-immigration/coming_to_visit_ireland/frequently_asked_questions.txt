## Will I be able to visit Northern Ireland, or other parts of the UK with an Irish Short Stay ‘C’ visa?

No. An Irish visit visa does not permit a person who is required to have a UK visa under UK immigration rules to enter the UK using an Irish visa.

However, under the terms of theBritish Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS)certain people who have an Irish Visa endorsed with “BIVS” may be permitted to travel to Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK, from Ireland, using that Irish visa.

“BIVS” endorsed visas are only available to Chinese people who are living in China and to Indian people living in India.

Inallother circumstances, if you wish to enter the UK (including Northern Ireland), you must be in possession of a valid UK visa.

## Can I avail of the Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme?

The Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme allows nationals of certain countries, who have entered the UK on foot of a UK short stay visa, to travel to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa. They instead may use the time remaining on their current leave to remain in the UK.

In order to avail of the Programme you must have landed and gained lawful entry to the UK on foot of your current UK visa, prior to undertaking the journey to Ireland.

Each distinct period of leave to remain in the UK (up to a maximum of 180 days each time) requires a prior legal entry into the UK before travel to Ireland under the programme, no matter what the duration of the UK visa.

This programme is not reciprocal. It does not permit a person who is a visa required national under UK immigration rules to enter the UK on foot of an Irish visa. If you wish to enter the UK (including Northern Ireland), you must be in possession of a valid UK visa.

You may be able to visit Ireland, for less than 90 days, without an Irish visa if you can answer “yes” to each of these questions:

- Do you have an eligible UK short stay visa?

and

- Does your visit to Ireland end before your permission to stay in UK ends (this is granted by an UK immigration official when you pass through UK immigration)?

and

- Was your passport issued by one of the countries listed in the list below?

You do not need a visa if you are aBritish citizen. Check if youneed a visa for Ireland.
