- How to register your immigration permission for the first time

Once Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) grants you a permission to stay in Ireland you must register it with the Irish immigration authorities within 90 days. If you cannot get an appointment within this period don’t worry – we will not cancel your permission or expect you to leave the country while you are waiting to register.

Registration is how we record you have been given permission to stay in Ireland. You may have been told to register your permission by an immigration officer at the airport or in a communication from Immigration Service Delivery (ISD). When you have successfully registered you will receive an Irish Residence Permit card by post and that is your proof that you are legally in the State.
