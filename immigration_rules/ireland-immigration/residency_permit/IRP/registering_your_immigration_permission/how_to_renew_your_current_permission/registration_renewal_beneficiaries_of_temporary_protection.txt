This means that your application has been received and will be processed by our staff in due course. This may take a number of months. Please be patient.

Please note:

Your current Temporary Protection Permission is still valid until we have made a decision on your application for renewal.Please do not resubmit your application or present at Citywest without an appointment.

Frequently Asked Questions

## Introduction

Do you have temporary protection in Ireland? If so, your current permission is valid until 4 March 2025. If you wish to avail of permission up to 4 March 2026you now need to apply to renew your permission.

It is vital that you complete your application as soon as possible, in order to ensure that you have a valid Temporary Protection permission.

## How to Apply Online to renew your Temporary Protection Permission

To apply online, please visit theIrish Immigration Service Onlinewebsite.

You will need to create an account on the ISD portal, using your email address, or log in, if you have an existing account. Once you have done this, you should select ‘Applications for Registration Renewals (including Temporary Protection)’ and select ‘Ukraine Temporary Protection Renewal’.

## What documents do I need to submit?

As part of the online renewal process, you will be required to submit the following documents:

Proof of Identity– Passport, National ID Card, Birth Certificate, Other ID Document

Proof of Permission– Temporary Protection Certificate; TP Replacement Letter; Irish Residence Permit

Proof of Residency in Ireland– Could include, but are not limited to: Evidence of employment; Proof of residence (e.g., lease agreement, utility bills); Education records; Documentation of contact with government agencies, etc.)

Please note:Proof of Residency documents must be dated within the last three months.

Other Documentation (Optional)– If applicable, you may upload any other relevant documents that support your application.

All beneficiaries are required to complete separate applications. A parent/guardian can complete a form on behalf of a minor. Please ensure to tick ‘YES’ below if you are filling out an application on behalf of a minor.

## Do I need to renew my Irish Residency Permit (IRP) Card?

Your Irish Residency Permit (IRP) Card will be processed together with your Temporary Protection. You do not need to apply to renew your IRP Card separately.

We may ask you to present in person at Citywest Transit Hub, in order to obtain further information from you about your application. If this is the case, you will receive an email to advise you of this, and then an officer will be in touch by phone to arrange an appointment. Please note, phone calls will be from a withheld number.

If you are asked to present at Citywest, please ensure that you bring all the necessary documentation with you on the day.

Please note that your current Temporary Protection permission will remain valid until you have completed the renewal process. This will be confirmed by an email notification once your application for renewal is completed.

An unsuccessful application to renew your temporary protection permission does not preclude you from choosing to avail of temporary protection in Ireland again in the future. Any new requests for temporary protection may be made by attending our office in Citywest.
