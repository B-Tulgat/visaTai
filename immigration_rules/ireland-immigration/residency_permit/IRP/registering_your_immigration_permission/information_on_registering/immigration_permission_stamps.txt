Stamp categoriesStamp conditionsStamps related to EU Treaty Rights

## Introduction

If you are coming to Ireland from outside the EU and Switzerland, and wish to stay for more than 90 days, you must apply to Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) for permission.

You will need this permission to work, study, live or join family in Ireland. For information about the various permission types please read below.

## Register your permission

Each permission type is illustrated by a stamp number, for example, stamp 1, stamp 2, stamp 3. The type of stamp you receive in your passport and stated on your Irish Resident Permit (IRP) card informs you what you can do and how long you can stay in Ireland. Please note that some permissions may not be entered in your passport. For more information pleaseread below.

Once you have a permission to stay in Ireland you must register it with the Irish immigration authorities, known as Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) within 90 days. If you cannot get an appointment within this period do not worry, as we will not cancel your permission or expect you to leave the country while you are waiting to register. However, please note that you must be able to demonstrate that you have sought an appointment within this 90 day period and that you have attempted to register as soon as possible. A person seeking to register beyond a reasonable time may be refused and issued with an intention to deport notification.

ISD registers first time permissions at Burgh Quay in Dublin. All subsequent permission renewals within the Republic of Ireland are to be applied foronline. When you have successfully registered you will receive an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card by post at the address you provided to ISD. An IRP card is not an identity card but it is an important document that proves you are residing legally in Ireland. You should always carry it with you and produce it to the authorities if asked.

## Registration office passport stamping

If the registration of your permission to stay in Ireland is successful, an Immigration Officer may stamp your passport, depending on the circumstances of your registration.

Please note that some permissions are granted without your passport being stamped.
