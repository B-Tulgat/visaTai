If you are coming to Ireland from outside the EU and Switzerland, and wish to stay for more than 90 days, you must apply for an immigration permission and then register it once it’s granted.

Registration is how we record you have been given permission to stay in Ireland. The type of permission you receive is printed on an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) sent to you by post once you have successfully registered.

Once permission is granted, you must register it within 90 days to apply for your IRP card. If you cannot get an appointment within this period don’t worry – we will not cancel your permission or expect you to leave the country while you are waiting to register.
