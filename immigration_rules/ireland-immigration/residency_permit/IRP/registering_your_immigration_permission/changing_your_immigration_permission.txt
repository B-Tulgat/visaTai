# Changing your immigration permission

- Changing your immigration permission

## In This Section

IntroductionChange in circumstancesCriteria to change immigration permission

## Introduction

Registering immigration permissions is how we record you have permission to stay in Ireland, how long you can stay, and what you can legally do while you are here. This is represented through an immigration ‘stamp’ placed in your passport when you register.

Please note that some permissions may not be entered in your passport, read morehere. Please read below for more information and what you are required to do to apply for a change in your immigration permission.

## Change in circumstances

Some people may need to change the type of immigration permission or stamp they have if their circumstances change. If you hold a valid permission, represented by a current Irish Residence Permit (IRP card) you may be able to apply to change either extend or vary your permission.

For example, if you have held a Critical Skills Employment Permit for at least two years, you may be able to apply for a different type of permission that offers greater benefits. If your permission is out of date, you cannot apply to change it. Submitting an application does not extend your current permission, so be sure to apply in plenty of time if you meet the criteria.

Each immigration stamp or permission requires different criteria and offers different conditions, for example, the ability to study or work or retire in Ireland. If your circumstances change while living in Ireland this may have an impact on your immigration permission and you must advise Immigration Service Delivery (ISD).

Please read morehereabout what you should do when your circumstances change.

Please note that, if you are here on a visitor’s permission for up to 90 days or if you are here on foot of a Working Holiday Authorisation (on Stamp 1) you are not permitted to change your permission. You are required to leave the State on or before the expiry of your permission. It would remain open to you to apply for another permission from outside the State after your departure.
