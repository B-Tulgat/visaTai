- Application for re-entry visas for minors (under 16)

Please be advised that Re-entry Visas for children departing the State and returning within a short term basisremain suspended until further notice. Children must be accompanied by their parent or legal guardian whohave an in date permission to reside in the State.  Please visitthe following pagefor further information.

## In This Section

IntroductionFlight Booked for Travel

## Introduction

The suspension of re-entry visa’s for minors under 16 was introduced by the Minister for Justice, and has been in place for some time now. At the time of the announcement, all airlines were notified of the suspension by TIMATIC – (Travel Information Manual Automatic). This company is a leading provider of real-time information on travel document requirements for international air travel and is an organisation which is trusted by airlines, travel agents, security agents, and government officials.

## Flight Booked for Travel

Applicants who have written to us concerning their travel plans are always advised to check with their Airline provider prior to booking or making travel plans to ensure that they are willing to accept children without re-entry visa’s on board their aircraft.

Despite the suspension of a requirement for re-entry visas, in certain urgent, emergency, or extenuating circumstances the provision of a re-entry visa can be considered.

Individuals, including those who have previously experienced challenges when connecting flights, are welcome to register for or log into their ownCustomer Serviceaccount and submit a query to us, requesting a re-entry visa for urgent, emergency, or extenuating circumstances. To ensure your query gets to the right team, please find information on categorising your query for re-entry visas and submitting it to the Registration Office here:Submitting Registration or Renewal Queries.

In order for an accompanying minor to be considered for a re-entry visa, we request the applicant to provide any relevant detail on an urgent or emergency need to travel, or extenuating circumstance experienced previously. Proof ofoutbound and return flighttickets are required, including details of connecting flights for planned upcoming travel.

The immigration support team will consider the request. All requests are considered on a case by case basis. There is no guarantee that your request will be facilitated.
