on European Union concerning travel facilities for school pupils from third countries 
resident in a Member State 
(94/795/JHA) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union and, in particular Article K.3 (2) (b) thereof, 
Having regard to the initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany, 
Whereas pursuant to Article K.I point 3 of the Treaty on European Union, policy regarding 
nationals of third countries is considered as a matter of common interest for the Member 
States; 
Whereas this policy includes, in particular, the determination of conditions of entry and 
movement by nationals of third countries on the territory of Member States in accordance 
with Article K.1 point 3 (a); 
Whereas the granting of travel facilities for school pupils who are legal residents in the 
European Union is an expression of a policy pursued by the Member States with a view to 
improved integration of third country nationals, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1 
1.   A Member State shall not require a visa of a school pupil who is not a national of a 
Member State but who is legally resident in another Member State and who seeks to enter its 
territory either for a short stay or transit if: 
(a)in the framework of a school excursion, the school pupil is travelling as a member of a 
group of school pupils from a general education school; 
(b)the group is accompanied by a teacher from the school in question who is able to present a 
list of the schoolchildren he or she is accompanying, issued by the school in question on 
the common form contained in the Annex: 
— identifying the school pupils being accompanied; 
— documenting the purpose and circumstances of the intended stay or transit; 
(c)the school pupil presents a travel document valid for crossing the border in question, 
except in cases covered by Article 2, 
2.   A Member State may refuse entry of a school pupil if he or she does not fulfil the other 
relevant national immigration conditions. 
Article 2 
The list of pupils which must be carried on crossing the border in question as required by 
Article 1 (1) (b) shall be recognized as a valid travel document in all Member States within 
the meaning of Article 1 (1) (c) where: 
—a current photograph is included on the list for any of the school pupils therein mentioned 
who are unable to identify themselves with an ID card bearing a photograph, 
—the responsible authority of the Member State in question confirms residence status of the 
school pupil as well as his or her right to re-entry and ensures that the document is 
authenticated accordingly, 
—the Member State in which the school pupils reside notifies other Member States that it 
wishes this Article to apply in respect of its own lists. 
Article 3 
Member States shall agree to take back without formalities school pupils who are resident 
third country nationals admitted into another Member State on the basis of this joint action. 
Article 4 
If, in exceptional cases, for urgent reasons of national security, a Member State needs to 
invoke the possibilities foreseen by Article K.2 (2) of the Treaty on European Union, it shall 
be able to deviate from the provisions of Article 1 of this Decision in a way which takes into 
consideration the interests of the other Member States. The Member State in question shall 
inform the other Member States of this in an appropriate manner. These measures may be 
applied to the extent that, and as long as, this is absolutely necessary to achieve the objective. 
Article 5

and the provisions of this joint action included in them as soon as possible, at the latest by 30 
June 1995.

required pursuant to Article 5 (2) regarding the changes made by the last Member State to 
complete this formality.
