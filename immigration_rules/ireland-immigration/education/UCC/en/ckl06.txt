## Course Outline

Our MSc Business Economics programme is an integrated course applying economics to the business environment. Designed in consultation with leaders from the business community and public sector organisations, this unique course equips you with the key skills for career development in the ever-changing business world. It also provides a good foundation for those interested in undertaking further study at PhD, DBA or professional development level.

The MSc Business Economics course is unique to UCC, incorporating both taught courses and action research, and using economic theory and analysis explicitly applied to business. Through the focused taught courses and conducting action research, you learn how to explain and apply core theories, empirical methods and a range of analytical tools that are relevant and transferable to a range of fundamental business issues.

In this course you will develop a portfolio of skills required to support business analysis and managerial decision-making. These skills include communication skills (written and oral), analytical and evaluation skills and team-working skills. Our market research has indicated that such skills are very highly rated by employers.

The course places emphasis on:

- the preparation and presentation of quality business reports

- techniques of data analysis that include forecasting and survey data analysis

- team-working for assignments to enhance interpersonal relationships

- a problem-solving approach using case studies

The MSc programme comprises two parts totalling 90 credits. The course is assessed by coursework, including presentations, written reports, in-class assessments, and group work. The part-time option will be taught during weekday working hours over two years.

## Course Practicalities

The course consists of approximately 12 hours of lectures/workshops a week, excluding visiting speaker seminars and time that you must set aside for group work and assignment preparation.

It culminates in the writing of abusiness economics reportwhere you will demonstrate an application of concepts and frameworks to an actual business situation facing an international business. This approach will demonstrate how you can translate your learning into practice. An external business advisor is appointed to provide guidance and advice in developing your solution.

The course is assessed by a combination of exams and coursework. Approximately 90% of the course is assessed by coursework, including presentations, written reports, in-class assessments, and group work.

We have a dedicated course teaching team drawn from the Department of Economics and our learning approach combines lectures, projects, seminars, group discussion, presentations along with individual and group reports. Seminars are also provided by visiting speakers from public and private sector organisations.
