- Analysis of Pharmaceutical Compounds

## Course Outline

MSc degree courses are provided in three key areas of Analytical Chemistry, Environmental Analytical Chemistry and in Pharmaceutical Analysis. They are designed to provide advanced knowledge and hands-on training in modern analytical instrumental techniques. Separation science, sensors, and spectroscopic techniques are key elements alongside chemometrics, instrumentation and advanced research project completion. Students will have the flexibility to specialise in a chosen field and further advancement to Ph.D. research is available to highly motivated and talented postgraduates.

The MSc in Analysis of Pharmaceutical Compounds is a one-year course designed to provide you with the theoretical and practical skills for employment in a diverse range of industries that require analytical expertise. The course curriculum consists of six months of lectures, laboratory practical sessions, career service workshops, industry-based seminars/workshops, site visits to industry and a six-month research project (industry, research institute, aboard).

The curriculum has been developed with input from staff in the chemistry department and also by the industry advisory board, to provide you with the necessary skills required by employers. Students have the choice to complete the six-month research project in a national or international industry or university environment. They also have the opportunity to present their research at the annual George Guilbault Symposium that is sponsored by industry with a number of awards being presented to students at this event.

On completion of this MSc course, you will be able to:

- identify, formulate, analyse and solve problems in the analysis of chemical compounds

- outline fundamental and applied aspects of chemical analysis

- design and carry out a method of pharmaceutical and chemical analysis, including instrumental analysis

- prepare written laboratory reports that provide a description of the experiment, explain the experiment and reasoning clearly, and provide an appropriate conclusion

- communicate effectively with the chemistry, environmental and pharmaceutical communities

- carry out research and method development in chemical, pharmaceutical and environmental analysis

- prepare a written research report in the form of a dissertation

Modules

The MSc course in Analysis of Pharmaceutical Compounds consists of eight-course modules that include lectures, set practical sessions, career service workshops, industry guest lectures, industry workshops and site visits and a six-month research project.

Students study 90 credits course work from the following modules:

Core Modules (60 credits)

- CM6012Modern Analytical Techniques, Chemical Data Analysis and GLP (10 credits)

- CM6013Separation Science, Sensors and Process Analytical Technology (10 credits)

- CM6014Materials, Pharmaceutical and Bio-analysis (10 credits)

- CM6015Practice of Analytical Chemistry (10 credits)

- CM6026Industry-Led Workshops (5 credits)

- CM6027Taught Postgraduate Transferable Skills Development (5 credits)

- PF6301Biopharmaceuticals: Formulation Design, Secondary Processing and Regulatory Compliance (10 credits)

Research Project Module (30 credits)

- CM6022Research Project and Dissertation in Pharmaceutical Analysis (30 credits)

Programme Requirements

The MSc Degree in Analysis of Pharmaceutical Compounds is awarded to successful candidates after passing written examinations across all taught modules, including the continuously assessed practical moduleCM6015, and the research project, which has to be written up in the form of a dissertation and approved by the external examiner.

The written examinations are split between the Winter and Spring examination periods. CM6012 and PF6301 are taken in the Winter, whilst CM6013 and CM6014 are taken in the Spring. Students taking the course part-time over two years can decide in advance what exams to take in each of the two years.

The research projects commence in Semester 2 and continue into Semester 3 and cover the time period of April to September. Dissertation completion and submission deadlines are the beginning of October each year.

Research Project and Industry Placement:

You will be required to complete a six-month research project based on your individual research and development in a selected field of modern science. You carry out your research in UCC’s laboratories or at an approved academic or industrial partner.

When you complete your research dissertation in an industrial setting, it provides the company with an opportunity to assess your skills and abilities and to screen potential future full-time employees. Students also have the opportunity to travel aboard to do their research project. This highlights the international recognition of the course and the close links established between the course and the relevant institutes.

Students who secure employment upon graduation fit into the organisation and contribute productively much sooner than other graduates. For students with an interest in future careers as PhD researchers, research projects are offered across a broad range of topics.

The part-time option will be taught during weekday working hours over 2 years.

## Course Practicalities

The courses consist of a 12-month full-time intensive programme of lectures, laboratory work on set experiments and a dissertation based on individual research and development in the selected field of modern analytical science, under the supervision of an expert staff member. Part-time students may complete the course over 24 months subject to flexible day release from the industry.

## Why Choose This Course

This is one of the most established Analytical MSc courses in Ireland and is amongst the more popular MSc courses studied in UCC. This MSc course, in particular, has great international success in attracting students from all over the World due to the industry-led teaching agenda. The industry-relevant curriculum offered to students and the opportunity to complete a six-month placement in industry or an academic research lab has also impacted greatly on the student experience. The global recognition of the course is also evident from our international alumni that maintain contact through a dedicated LinkedIn group.

This course also has an Industry Advisory Board that provides crucial industry feedback on both the teaching strategy and practice for the taught postgraduate course in Analytical Chemistry. There are currently 18 companies on this board with representatives from the Pharmaceutical, BioPharma, Biomedical Device, Environment and Food/Beverage sectors. There are a number of guest lectures from industry and a dedicated industry led module where students participate in a series of workshops either delivered on site with the industry partner or hosted by the Tyndall National Institute.

Annually, the George Guilbault Symposium provides the MSc students with an opportunity to present their Thesis projects. This event is run over two days, with all students presenting. An evening reception also takes places where students have the chance to present a poster on their research work and engage with the industry. Students are shortlisted for presenting to the industry judges on the second day and these presentations are distributed amongst several keynote presentations made by industry. All the awards (Best Presentation and Best Poster) are sponsored by industry.

This MSc course in Analysis of Pharmaceutical Compounds gives students a broad foundation in analytical chemistry and its application in an industrial setting with emphasis on method selection, development and validation for pharmaceutical compounds and the application to quality control and trace drug analysis. It also provides them with an opportunity to gain much sought-after and valued industry relevant training and qualification in an analytical division.
