## Course Outline

Data Science & Analytics focuses on new ways to capture and understand data from the world around us. It helps us make better decisions for people, communities and industry.

Our BSc in Data Science & Analytics degree at UCC provides education in data storage, manipulation and interpretation using mathematical sciences and computational methods which assists us in solving complex real-world problems. In the first and second year, you will study the mathematical and computational foundations of data science and analytics. During the third year, you begin applying the fundamentals of data science and analytics to real-life problems and data.

In the Spring of third year, you undertake a six-month work placement (which is paid in most cases), providing an opportunity to apply the knowledge you have learned in a workplace environment.

In the fourth year, you choose specialised modules and undertake an independent project, which enables you to investigate more applied elements of the discipline.

- CS1106Introduction to Relational Databases (5 credits)

- CS1112Foundations of Computer Science I (5 credits)

- CS1113Foundations of Computer Science II (5 credits)

- CS1117Introduction to Programming (15 credits)

- AM1054Mathematical Software (5 credits)

- MA1058Introduction to Linear Algebra (5 credits)

- MA1059Calculus (5 credits)

- ST1050Statistical Programming in R (5 credits)

- ST1051Introduction to Probability and Statistics (5 credits)

Plus 5 credits from the following:

The BSc in Data Science and Analytics at UCC is one of few such programmes being offered in Ireland today. Our course will provide you with an education in data storage, manipulation and interpretation, usingmathematical sciences and computational methods which will assist you to solve complex real-world problems.

This programme will suit you if have an aptitude for mathematics, logic and computational thinking, an enquiring mind and a willingness to adapt.

Graduates of the UCC BSc in Data Science and Analytics have vast opportunities in a wide variety of industries as there is a high global demand for graduates with data science expertise. Since data science is an emerging field, with only a limited number of degree programmes available, on graduation you will be able to fulfil the increasing demand for these specialist skills. Almost all sectors of the economy and community need to understand the enormous data sets available.

### Placement or Study Abroad Information

The BSc Data Science & Analytics aims to ensure that you are work-ready. Work placement is a core module undertaken from Spring until August in Year 3.

To find a placement organisation, you will work with the Careers Service. They will help you with interviews and keep in contact with you during placement. Usually you will complete your third-year examinations in December, return to campus for an 8 week semester in January, and then go on work placement from March to August (inclusive).

The placement helps you put academic theories into practice, improves your confidence, allowing you to travel and gain experience, and certainly increases your employability. Working in a company setting provides you with additional skills that cannot be taught through lectures or in the laboratory. During placement, you will work as part of a team to solve real problems. Your placement is jointly monitored by a UCC academic staff member and an employee of the company.

### Skills and Careers Information

As a data science graduate, you will have studied computer science, statistics, mathematics and applied mathematics, which qualifies you to progress to numerous taught and research-led Masters or PhD programmes in Mathematical Sciences or Computer Science. Programmes to consider in UCC include:

- MSc Computing Science

- MSc Actuarial Science

- MSc Financial & Computational Mathematics

- MSc Bioinformatics & Computational Biology

- MSc Mathematical Modelling & Machine Learning

- MSc Statistics (by research)

Firms specialising in analytics, financial services and consulting, and governmental agencies, to name but a few, are currently seeking graduates with data analytics skills to fill a range of positions.

The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2022, data scientists and analysts will become the number one emerging role in the world. Data science experts are needed in virtually every job sector, not just technology. In the US, the average data scientist salary is US$113,000, according to Glassdoor. (World Economic Forum 2020)

Practically all sectors of the economy employ Data Scientists.  The following list provides some insight into sectors and companies that use such skills:

- Bankinge.g. AIB, BoI, Central Bank, Citi
