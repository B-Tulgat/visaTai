Language Requirements 
 
Lectures are conducted through the medium of English. Good knowledge of English is 
therefore essential. Each international student application must master the English 
language sufficiently well to understand lectures and work with English language 
textbooks. 
 
We do not require Erasmus students to provide English language certificates. We 
trust that nominated students have a sufficient level of the language to take part in 
lectures and lessons.

English language courses are available at the Language Centre, UCC. During the first 
week of each semester, the Language Centre arranges for an informal assessment of 
the standard of students interested in attending English language classes. Advice is 
given about which course is most appropriate. Please note that students are required 
to pay for most English language courses.

Information regarding accommodation is available at 
https://www.ucc.ie/en/accommodation/ 
 
Students should also consult the UCC Student Pad website:

Unfortunately, UCC is not able to guarantee accommodation to our incoming visiting 
students. Students should remain proactive in sourcing their own accommodation 
before their arrival. 
 
Students will receive the link to the online accommodation application form 
when their completed application form has been received. UCC’s Accommodation 
and Community Life Office will then contact the students directly. The provisional 
accommodation cost is between €1000 - €1100 per month.
