Lecturers also consult for industry and publish regularly in international journals that are pertinent to industry and practice.

The programme boasts relatively small class sizes (approximately 70 students). This creates a student-friendly environment in which students benefit from high levels of guidance, support and peer networking, forming an excellent foundation for the development of life skills, critical thinking, problem-solving and teamwork.

The degree is designed to produce high-quality graduates equipped with skills to succeed in a variety of diverse roles while also offering a fast track to a career as a professional accountant. The programme maximises the exemptions from Professional Accounting body exams relative to other UCC undergraduate degrees (see Professional Accountancy Qualification below for more information).

The majority of graduates go on to qualify as Professional Accountants and subsequently go on to pursue successful careers in diverse roles in a range of sectors.

Recruitment of UCC accounting graduates remains exceptionally high among leading firms nationally and internationally.

### More from our recent Graduates

Annie Blewitt – 2020 graduate. Assurance Assoc PwC

When I was in school, I was most driven in the numbers-related subjects, as most who consider a career in Accounting are. Of course, this drive comes in incredibly useful throughout this four-year degree, but the study of this degree also opens up a world beyond the numbers, a concept that I, myself, may not have considered altogether attractive before actually experiencing it. In this degree, you learn that there is so much more to accounting than the oh-so important balancing of a balance sheet or the profit or loss in a set of accounts. There is a history to the methods you take so much for granted, a knack to the calculations you may not even fully understand yet, and a world of opportunities you may not have even considered as you didn’t realise they were even possible down the path of accountancy.

Following my four years in the Accounting degree, I can confidently enter the jobs market knowing that I have the experience to back me up in any interview thanks to the six month work placement I had in my third year, and the support of a hard-earned but rewarding education in the UCC course that is highly esteemed by any employer I happen to encounter. I personally enjoy the knowledge that I have a graduate programme waiting for me after my graduation, thanks to my placement in PwC that I secured through the Accounting course’s placement co-ordinator who facilitates placement applications and interviews for Accounting students. Without the help of the accounting department’s lecturers and staff, this process would have been exponentially more difficult, and I am grateful for all the help I have been offered in this area.

Faolan Carberry – 2019 Graduate, Assurance Assoc, PwC

A big advantage of the BSc Accounting degree is the smaller class sizes compared to other business courses. This results in lectures being conducted in a more friendly and open environment, where questions are encouraged. It is also much easier to make friends with classmates which is a key part of any positive college experience.

If you are studying accounting for the Leaving Cert and wish to pursue accounting further, I believe the BSc Accounting degree is the best degree for you. Regardless of what professional qualification you pursue after college, no other UCC degree will provide you with as many exemptions as the BSc Accounting degree. Working and studying at the same time is challenging and the BSc Accounting degree minimises the amount of time which will have to be spent both working and studying which is a big advantage of the programme. Furthermore, the BSc Accounting degree also provides you with a substantial grounding in the topics which will be covered in the professional exams.

The lecturers on the programme are experts in their field coming from a wide range of backgrounds. Some have taught extensively on professional accountancy programmes while others have risen to top positions in the business world. This mixture of professional and educational experience leads to focused modules which are geared towards applying business concepts to practical situations.

When you are in the workplace, you will need more than just academic results to succeed. You will also need excellent communication, teamwork and presentation skills and the BSc Accounting Degree provides you with plenty of opportunities to develop these skills. The six-

month work placement in Third Year is also a great opportunity to gain first hand accountancy experience.

Katie Crowley – 2019 Graduate, Assurance Assoc, PwC

My name is Katie Crowley and I graduated from the BSc in Accounting in 2019. I thoroughly enjoyed my four years at UCC and would highly recommend the degree.

Over the four years I got the opportunity to complete a variety of modules in Accounting, Economics, Management, Finance, Statistics, BIS, Law, Excel, Tax and more. As well as providing you with a rounded education of accountancy and the wider business world, you also develop many vital soft skills such as presentation, teamwork, and interview skills. The course contains 12 hours of lectures per week plus tutorials which is very manageable. This allows plenty time to get involved in college life and join a club or society. The Accounting and Finance society organizes the annual A&F ball as well as many other events during the year.

In third year, we got the chance to go on a 6-month paid placement from January to June. This was a great opportunity to get real experience in the workplace while we still had July and August to enjoy some time off before beginning final year. At the end of my 6 months in PwC they offered to sponsor me on a master’s in accounting before joining their firm to complete a three-year graduate program and qualify as a Chartered Accountant. Many people in the course secured graduate programs at the end of placement which is one thing less to worry about when entering final year.

The BSc in Accounting maximises your exemptions from professional accountancy exams with ACA, CAI, CIMA, CPAI and CTA. No other UCC degree provides you with as many exemptions from professional accountancy exams. I am going down the ACA route which involves three sets of exams, CAP1s, CAP2s and FAEs. The BSc in Accounting is the only degree at UCC which leaves you fully exempt from CAP1s which means I only had 2 sets of exams to complete after I graduated.

The Chartered Accountant qualification is recognised worldwide meaning there is an opportunity to travel and work abroad as an accountant once you have qualified. Accountants are always in high demand because with every business it all comes back to the bottom line.

> The biggest misconception about accounting is that it's a boring job, sometimes I wish it was boring

### Caroline Crowley, Founder CPC Outsourcing, BSc Accounting Graduate

> The course offers a broad range of subjects such as Law, Economics, Marketing etc which gave me the opportunity to discover new interests.

### Tilly Downes, Associate at PwC

### Ailís McCarthy, Assurance Associate at PwC

> The BSc Accounting degree at UCC gave me the opportunity to work in one of the top accounting firms for 6 months. This was a very valuable experience where I got to apply my knowledge

### Sarah Draper, UK & I Assurance Senior at EY

> The degree gave me the knowledge, experience and confidence to work with the largest professional services firm in the world

### Brendan Foley,

Finance Manager at Johnson & Johnson

“What I found interesting about this course is the wide spectrum of subject matter covered. The six- month placement enables students to work in some of the world’s top companies and enhances prospects of returning to that employer on graduation. The degree gave me the knowledge, experience and confidence to work with the largest professional services firm in the world”

> The programme is an excellent stepping stone to a career in the accountancy profession, in finance or in business generally.

### Ronan O'Loughlin,

Director of Education & Training, Chartered Accountants Ireland

Graduates from the BSc Accounting programme in UCC have consistently performed well in the examinations of Chartered Accountants Ireland. Indeed the programme is an excellent stepping stone to a career in the accountancy profession, in finance or in business generally.

> BSc Accounting boasts a wide range of modules that allows its students flexibility in what path they want to follow.
