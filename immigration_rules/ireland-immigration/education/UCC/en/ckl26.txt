## Course Outline

This one-year full-time course offers a postgraduate route to a career in professional accounting. It offers you the chance to complete much of the study and examination requirements involved in qualifying as an accountant. Upon successful completion of all requirements of the course, you will gain full exemption from all but the Final Admitting Examination (FAE) ofChartered Accountants Ireland(CAI).

The course offers more than exemptions. As well as intensive tuition in the core technical materials assessed in the professional examinations, you will gain exposure to the emerging contemporary issues in accounting and finance that will shape your working environment and the future economy. Personal competencies and skills in commercial judgment are also developed to give you a competitive edge as you embark on your career in accounting. In addition, MAcc graduates qualify for exemption from all papers in part 1 of the AITI Chartered Tax Adviser (CTA) qualification.

Students take a total of 90 credits. Part I consists of taught modules to the value of 60 credits. Part II consists of 30 credits devoted to the development of independent research skills relevant to the work of a modern professional accountant in practice, industry and financial services.

## Course Practicalities

Lectures take place Monday-Thursday in Room 3.14, O’Rahilly Building, UCC.  This dedicated room in the department is available to MAcc students for individual and group work on Fridays and at weekends.  Occasional seminars, site visits and other professional training activities also take place on some Fridays.

There is also a significant commitment in terms of assignments, case study preparation and individual study. The workload reflects the demands expected in the early stages of a professional career and students should plan their year on the basis that this is a full-time course.

There may be opportunities for students to act as undergraduate tutors.
