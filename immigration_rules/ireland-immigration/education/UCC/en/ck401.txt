## Course Practicalities

- Work placement is mandatory in both routes of this course in Year 3.

- The annual 60-credits workload typically equates to 12 hours of lectures per week and a comparable amount for laboratory work and tutorials.

## Why Choose This Course

> Choosing to study computer science in UCC may be the best decision I’ve ever made...

### David O'Leary, Graduate, IBM

> For your work experience in 3rd Year you can spend 6 or 12 months on a work placement and it's invaluable when you graduate.

### Marina, BSc Computer Science

Computer Science encompasses all aspects of computer systems, software and hardware, as well as information and communications technology. Topics include software development, database technology, computer networks, operating systems, algorithms, security, web technology and applications. Graduates learn to harness the potential of these technologies to develop useful and sophisticated computer applications.

The School of Computer Science and Information Technology aims to ensure you are work-ready, and it has a mandatory work placement module in Year 3.

To complement the work placement module, you will undertake a Year 4 project, supervised by one of our academic staff. This will require you to apply your knowledge to a technological challenge of your choice and will help develop your skills and understanding of computer science.

### Placement or Study Abroad Information

At the end of third year, you will undertake mandatory work placement which provides real-life experience of the workplace. The placement can be for 6 months (March to September) or 12 months (from March).

Working in a company setting provides you with additional skills that cannot be taught through lectures or in the laboratory. Most students rate this as one of the most valuable and rewarding aspects of their degree course and many return to work with their placement company after graduation. Typically, you will be attached to an existing team within the organisation and involved in the work of that team within the company.

Our students have been placed in SME’s, national and international companies. Companies that repeatedly employ student on placement include DELL EMC, Amazon, Intel, Pilz, Teamwork, Tapadoo, Workday, EMBL, Laya Healthcare, McAfee, CoreHR, Fidelity Investments, JLR, Johnson Controls, KPMG, Accenture, Tyco, IBM, Janssen, Microsoft, Netgear and others.

Opportunities to study abroad are available under the Erasmus programme. UCC also has a range of links with institutions outside Europe that provide further opportunities for study abroad on a competitive basis.

### Skills and Careers Information

The School of Computer Science and Information Technology has a large and active postgraduate research student community. More details on our research activities can be found on the School'sresearch page. Some of the school's research centres offer internships for talented undergraduates during the summer. Once you graduate, you are well placed to pursue postgraduate studies at Masters of PhD level, at home or abroad.

Programmes taken by graduates of the BSc Computer Science include:

- MSc Data Science and Analytics

- MSc Computing Science

- MSc Interactive Media

- PhD programmes in Computer Science

IT companies actively seek Computer Science graduates, and we find that the work placement in third year boosts your employability. Our graduates have gone on to work in a variety of jobs including software engineers, software developers, information systems engineers, network engineers, technical analysts, creative designers, app developers and many more.

The technology sector in Ireland directly employs over 105,000 people, with 75% employed in multinational companies and the remainder in the indigenous digital technology sector.

In 2017 92% of graduates from the BSc (Hons) Computer Science surveyed were in employment while a further 6% went on to further study or training. Employers taking people on from this cohort of graduates included Dell EMC, Google, Amazon Web Services, Johnson Controls, McAfee, Teamwork, McKesson, Stryker, and many more.

Ireland is home to:

- The top 5 global software companies

- 9 of the top 10 US technology companies

- Top 3 global Enterprise Software Companies

- 4 of the top 5 IT services companies  (Source:idaireland.com)

> “Driven by the continued growth of Ireland as a global technology hub, as well as the spread of digitalisation across all sectors of the economy, demand is forecast to grow at 8.5% annually, generating potential job openings of almost 73,000 during the period 2018-2022.”
