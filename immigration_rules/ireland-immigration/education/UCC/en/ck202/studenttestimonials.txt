## Current 4th Year Accounting Student's Testimonials

Often, there is a misconception that accounting is all about numbers. However, this course offers a broad range of subjects such as Law, Economics, Marketing etc. which gave me the opportunity to discover new interests. Due to the range of subjects and areas covered, the course is an excellent base for anyone looking to enter the business world. - Tilly Downes

I believe a key benefit of BSc Accounting is the invaluable opportunity of a 6-month placement with an accounting firm in my 3rd year. I came out of my placement with a far clearer view of what path I wanted to follow directly after college. Having that relevant work experience on my CV also proved a valuable advantage while interviewing for subsequent jobs.

BSc Accounting boasts a wide range of modules that allows its students flexibility in what path they want to follow. The degree does not limit you to accounting but allows you to pursue a wide range of disciplines from finance to statistics to information systems - however, you can also enjoy many exemptions from the professional accounting exams.

The course also offers great support to its students. I have found the lecturers to have an open-door policy over my four years in the course and was never refused an opportunity to discuss anything to do with a module or exam. I also found tutorials to be plentiful, exam-relevant and helpful over the 4 years.

I would also say the BSc Accounting course is very highly regarded and well known by employers in the industry - boasting extremely high employment rates after college, particularly with the big 4 firms. – David Kavanagh

The BSc Accounting degree is a brilliant course. One of the many elements of the course which I like is the broad choice of modules. Along with the core accounting modules, students are given a wide variety of electives to choose from, such as economics, law and information systems. This allows students to develop a wider business knowledge and gives students the choice to pick modules that they enjoy. The skills and knowledge that can be gained from studying Accounting in UCC creates numerous job opportunities for students in the future. – Sinead Crowley

I'm so glad I chose to study Accounting at UCC. It is an excellent degree for anyone who has an interest in the areas of business, accounting and finance. The degree is taught by knowledgeable lecturers, who have great expertise and experience in working in a real business environment. The 6-month work placement gave me the opportunity to put my college studies into practice. This degree has given me the opportunity to complete a Masters in Accounting and to work in globally recognised companies after college. A small class size allows for more interaction between students and lecturers. The BSc Accounting degree has given me the confidence, knowledge and experience to pursue any career in business. – Ailis McCarthy

The BSc Accounting degree at UCC gave me the opportunity to work at one of the top accounting firms for 6 months. This was a very valuable experience where I got to apply my knowledge learnt through the course in everyday tasks within the firm. I really enjoyed the variety of modules covered and the strong relationship with academic staff throughout my four years at UCC. – Sarah Draper

The BSC Accounting offers students an opportunity to develop key technical and analytical accounting skills. Students acquire commercial awareness, independent thinking and a strategic pathway to Chartered Accountancy. – Niall Galvin

One of the best things about the Accounting degree in UCC was the opportunity to do the placement in 3rd year. I worked in a big accounting firm for 6 months and saw how relevant the material we study in college is when you start work. I also liked this course because of the small class sizes compared to other courses. This allowed me to engage with the lecturers more in class and they are all very supportive and want you to do well. – Niamh Dolan
