- Full Academic Year Course

## Course Outline

This  Full Academic Year Programme is only available to students currently registered at another university outside of Europe. Your study period at UCC must be part of your degree back home.

Students may take up to 60 credits in the academic year. A limited number of internship opportunities are also available.

Visiting students can combine modules from different academic departments/schools/colleges and across different levels from introductory (year 1) to senior level (year 4). The course allows you to be flexible in selecting modules, although certain pre-requisites may be required for admission to specific modules. In addition, students should also be aware of possible timetable conflicts when putting together their schedules.

## Course Practicalities

Courses at UCC are taught in modules. A module represents a self-contained fraction ofa student’s workload for the academic year. The size of the module is represented by its credit weighting. In general, Full Academic Year modules are valued at either 5, 10, 15 or 20 credits. A standard 5 credit module offered in the College of Arts, Celtic Studies and Social Sciences, could, for example, consist of 24 lecture-hours, plus associated tutorials, essays, and reading. In the Sciences, labs or practicals, as they are known at UCC, are often a compulsory component of a module.

Assessment is usually by written examination and by work submitted during the academic year. Formal examinations are held in December and May. Departmental/School examinations and assessments take place at various times during the academic year. Modules offered in the sciences will normally include a practical (or lab). As visiting students enrolled in the Full Academic Year Programme are permitted to choose modules from across different colleges and years, there is a possibility that examination timetable conflicts will occur. In the event of such conflicts arising, alternative arrangements are made by the International Education Office.

## Why Choose This Course

The Full Academic Year Programme provides visiting students with the opportunity to enrol in modules across a wide range of subjects at UCC. Flexibility is a key component of the course. Students can construct their own programme of study, comprising modules at an introductory level where there has been no previous exposure to a subject, and modules at a more advanced or senior level where you have previously studied a particular subject.

In addition, a suite of modules, exclusively available to visiting students, is offered in areas such asarchaeology, English, folklore, geography, history, history of art, modern Irish, music and spoken Irish. These modules, which require no previous knowledge of the subject, provide the visiting student with an introduction to Ireland’s history, culture, civilisation and environment.

### Skills and Careers Information

To live in a country other than one’s own is a means of opening doors that otherwise would remain closed. In today’s globalised society, a study-abroad experience is highly desirable and is increasingly valued by employers. The Full Academic Year Programme at UCC provides visiting students with the opportunity to experience a different academic environment and to immerse yourselves in Irish culture. At the end of the academic year, visiting students will have gained an insight into Ireland, past and present, and will have had the opportunity to develop, both personally and academically.

## Requirements

The minimum grade point average (GPA) requirement for admission to the programme is normally 3.0 out of 4.0

## Fees and Costs

Please refer to our section 'What will it cost?' on ourVisiting Student Website
