- Early Start Semester in Irish History and Modern Ireland

## Course Outline

### Course Outline

The Early Start Semester in History and Modern Ireland provides the visiting student with an overview of Irish history in the 19th and 20th centuries, concentrating on the pivotal events of 1912-1923. The complex and contentious issues of Irish nationalism are made accessible to the overseas student, who not only may have no grounding in Irish history, but may be entirely new to the study of history overall. The necessary narrative history is reinforced by examination of the primary pictorial and documentary sources.

Contents:

- Conquest and Union: the historical background

- The Green Flag: the rise of Irish nationalism

- Famine and Diaspora: politicising bitterness

- Violence versus constitutionalism, Republic versus Home Rule

- The Home Rule Crisis and the First World War

- 1916 and after: the triumph of failure

- Troubles and emergencies: independent Ireland from 1922

- The Six Counties: the unfinished business
