Undergraduate Academic Calendar

For more detailed information on the undergraduate programmes, please visit:http://www.ucc.ie/academic/calendar/

Book of Modules

The Book of Modules contains information on modularisation along with descriptions for all modules offered in the University's modularised courses. Please visit the following link:http://www.ucc.ie/academic/modules/

Fitness to Practice

Some students are required to undertake placement and training that involve dealing directly with patients, clients or service users. Since it is of over-riding importance to protect members of the public from harm and to maintain the trust and confidence of the general public in the professions and the University, it is vital that students are deemed fit to practise while on placement. To describe an individual as ‘Fit to Practise’ in the context of certain professions is to say that he/she possesses the attributes considered necessary in an individual to allow on-going practice as an independent practitioner in the relevant profession.

For further information on Fitness to Practise policies and procedures click here:http://www.ucc.ie/en/academicsecretariat/fitnesstopractise/
