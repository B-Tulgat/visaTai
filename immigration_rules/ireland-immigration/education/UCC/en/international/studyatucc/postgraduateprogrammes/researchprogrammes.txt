## What Can I Study?

UCC has a world-class research reputation with many internationally renowned research institutions and centres. UCC has a wide range of research programmes on offer. These include Structured PhDs, Research Masters, MD and PhD track programmes.

We offer students the opportunities to undertake supervised research in all departments/schools of the university, at master or doctoral level. Assessment is by thesis which is examined at the end of your study period. The structure and assessment of research degrees can vary. Students are afforded the choice of studying wholly within the university or in collaboration with other universities in Ireland or internationally. Research degrees involve students following their own timetable of academic study, under the supervision of an academic supervisory team. For more information on UCC research centres and institutes please check out ourUCC Research website.

- Expert supervision from leading scholars in their fields, engaged in cutting-edge, international-quality research

- A large, friendly and diverse graduate community

- Regular research events (conferences, workshops, seminars)

- Generic and transferable skills modules provided free of charge to research students

- Attractive campus located in the heart of Cork city

Book of Modules

The Book of Modules contains information on modularisation along with descriptions for all modules offered in the University's modularised courses. Please visit the following link:http://www.ucc.ie/academic/modules/

Fitness to Practice

Some students are required to undertake placement and training that involve dealing directly with patients, clients or service users. Since it is of over-riding importance to protect members of the public from harm and to maintain the trust and confidence of the general public in the professions and the University, it is vital that students are deemed fit to practise while on placement. To describe an individual as ‘Fit to Practice’ in the context of certain professions is to say that he/she possesses the attributes considered necessary in an individual to allow on-going practice as an independent practitioner in the relevant profession.

For further information on Fitness to Practice policies and procedures click here:http://www.ucc.ie/en/academicsecretariat/fitnesstopractise/

Am I an EU or Non-EU Student?
