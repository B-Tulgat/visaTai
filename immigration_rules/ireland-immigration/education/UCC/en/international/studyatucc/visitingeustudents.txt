## Overview

Students from European universities that do not have an Erasmus+ agreement with University College Cork can also apply as Fee-Paying EU students.

We have over 3,300 international students studying at the University during a typical academic year. They come from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures and do much to enhance and enrich life at the University. Many of you will be some distance from home and we will do our best to ensure that your stay with us will be academically rewarding and socially enjoyable.

We hope you will find the information in this website informative and helpful. We are confident that your stay with us will be a fruitful one and that you will leave Ireland with fond memories of your time spent in University College Cork.
