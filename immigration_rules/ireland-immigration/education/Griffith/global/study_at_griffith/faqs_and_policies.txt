## President’s Award

TheGriffith College President’s Awardrecognises learners who make a significant contribution to supporting and enhancing the lives of others, mostly through volunteering efforts, during their time as a student. Examples of volunteering roles and projects undertaken by learners can vary hugely depending on the learners’ particular interests, skill sets, and the needs in the specific community they wish to advance

Through their voluntary support, learners can gain valuable experience and insights into the particular circumstances and needs of others, and can also directly advance their own interpersonal and leadership skills. These skills complement the knowledge and competences learners develop on their academic programmes, creating more informed and reflective graduates.

Participation in the award is on an opt-in basis through an application process. The award welcomes a variety of applications and recognises that learners have various interests and different volunteering opportunities open to them. The committee which reviews the applications comprises a number of representatives from across the College’s faculties and support departments. Learners who are added to the President’s Roll of Honour receive a medal in recognition of their contribution and a letter of merit from the President of Griffith College. The letter of merit is awarded at Gold, Silver or Bronze in recognition of the effort shown and the learning from participation in the activity.

## Student of the Year

At every Griffith College Graduation ceremony, one exemplary student wins the “Student of the Year” and they are given a prize by the College President in recognition of their high achievements academically, along with other factors which have enhanced their student experience and that of their classmates.

## Faculty Awards

Griffith College also has a long and illustrious history of award-winners and prize recipients. A number of Griffith College students have been recognised for their efforts in the fields of Law, Accounting, Journalism and Communications, Computing and Design.
