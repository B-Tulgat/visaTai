Studying at Grifﬁth has been the best 
experience ever. Studying Design 
here is not just about software - it’s 
very hands on and you get the 
opportunity to combine traditional 
techniques with new techniques. I 
met people from around the world 
and having the opportunity to study 
with teachers who work in the 
industry was something I really 
enjoyed.
