LOCATION
The college is based on a large 
5-acre campus on Wellington 
Road, in the heart of Cork city. 
Our relaxed and productive 
atmosphere is achieved by 
developing a strong pastoral care 
ethos, evidenced by the open-door 
policy of lecturers, the operation of 
all lectures on a ﬁrst-name basis, 
the provision of both written and 
oral feedback on formal and 
informal assignments, and the 
close, friendly working relationship 
between students and staff, all of 
which are based on a spirit of trust 
and collaboration.
