WHAT SETS US APART
02
It really gave me a broad understanding of 
what the industry wants and needs. Also, it 
helped me adapt my skills to work within 
the industry, and I think its really paid off. 
From what I heard, there is no other masters 
like it. I really think that if I didn’t do the 
masters I wouldn’t be where I am today.
The lecturers are delivered by current 
industry experts with years of experience, 
which made my training rich in knowledge 
of new advancements, trends and 
regulations across biopharmaceutical and 
clinical research sectors. This gives me a 
distinct advantage during my job search, 
which is reﬂected in the response I get 
from recruiters.
