WHAT IS A DIRECT DEBIT SCHEME AND HOW DOES IT WORK? 
 
Simply, a Direct Debit is an instruction from you to your bank giving permission to Griffith College to 
collect your fees directly from your bank account.  Once you have signed and returned the above 
mandate, Griffith College can then collect the fees from your bank account as per the schedule 
below.  Under the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), all bank accounts must be identified by an 
International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and a Bank Identifier Code (BIC).  The list of SEPA countries 
includes all 27 EU member states plus Switzerland, the UK, San Marino, Vatican City, Andorra, Monaco 
and the 3 EEA countries of Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
