03.
1. Understand people better
Many people are attracted to and choose to study 
Psychology to gain insight into their own and other 
people’s 
behaviours, 
perceptions, 
and 
motivations. 
Psychology offers students the chance to explore the 
human mind and discover why we think and act the way 
we do.
2. Progress into varied career possibilities
Many 
graduates 
enter 
the 
profession 
as 
clinical 
psychologists, 
educational 
psychologists, 
forensic 
psychologists, occupational and health psychologists 
across a range of industries. A signiﬁcant number of 
graduates continue their research and become academics 
while others pursue careers in areas such as business, 
marketing, neuroscience and consulting.
3. Improve wellbeing in society
The many and varied sub-disciplines in Psychology all have 
one objective in common: to improve the lives and 
wellbeing of people and society. This might be in schools 
and colleges, in the workplace, in therapeutic settings or in 
the wider community. As a psychologist, you could work 
towards improving people’s wellbeing.
4. Enhance your transferable skills
You will gain many transferable skills during your studies, 
including teamwork, critical thinking, project management 
and research. These qualities are highly sought after by 
many employers across different sectors. You will also learn 
how to engage with people effectively and be able to

of our daily lives, and good interpersonal skills are beneﬁcial 
for job interviews and workplace relationships.
