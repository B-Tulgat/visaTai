Cost of Living for International Students at Griffith College: What to Expect 
Studying abroad is an exciting adventure, but managing your finances effectively is key to a stress-free experience. Whether 
you're moving to Dublin, Cork, or Limerick to study at Griffith College, it's important to understand the cost of living in Ireland 
and how to budget accordingly. 
This guide will break down the average expenses you can expect as an international student, including accommodation, 
transport, food, and social activities. 
Accommodation: Finding the Right Place to Live 
Your biggest expense as a student will likely be accommodation. Griffith College offers on-campus housing at the Griffith Halls 
of Residence (GHR), but many students also choose off-campus accommodation depending on availability and personal 
preference. 
• 
On-Campus Accommodation 
Griffith Halls of Residence provides student-friendly housing with modern facilities. Prices start at €209 per week, with further 
details available here. 
• 
Off-Campus Accommodation 
If you prefer to live off-campus, rental costs will vary depending on location, amenities, and whether you share with 
housemates. Here’s what you can expect: 
• 
Single room in a shared apartment: €600 – €1,000 per month 
• 
Private studio apartment: €1,200+ per month 
• 
Shared house (cost split among housemates): €500 – €900 per month 
Dublin’s rental market is competitive, so it’s advisable to secure accommodation before arriving. More details on off-campus 
options can be found here. 
Transport: Getting Around the City 
Ireland has a reliable public transport system, and as a student, you can save money with a Student Leap Card—a discounted 
travel card for students. 
• 
Monthly transport costs: €120 – €150 
• 
Annual estimate: €1,440 – €1,350 (academic year) 
The Leap Card provides discounted fares on buses, trams (Luas), and trains in Dublin and other cities. Registration costs €5, and 
you can top up the card based on your usage. For more details, visit Leap Card  and watch step by step guide on how it works. 
Food & Grocery Expenses 
Your food budget will depend on whether you cook at home or eat out frequently. Shopping at budget-friendly supermarkets 
like Lidl, Aldi, Tesco, and Dunnes Stores will help keep costs down. 
• 
Monthly estimate: €180 – €250 
• 
Yearly estimate: €2,160 – €2,250 
Cooking at home is significantly cheaper than eating out, where restaurant meals cost around €10 – €20 per meal. Many 
students find a balance by preparing meals at home and dining out occasionally. 
Social Life & Entertainment 
Studying in Ireland isn't just about academics—you’ll want to enjoy your time here too. From weekend trips to live music events 
and student meetups, budgeting for social activities is important. 
• 
Monthly estimate: €80 – €150 
• 
Yearly estimate: €960 – €1,350 
Many student events and cultural activities are free or discounted, so there are plenty of ways to enjoy Irish life on a budget.

resources. 
• 
Monthly estimate: €100 – €150 
• 
Yearly estimate: €1,200 – €1,350 
Certain courses may require additional equipment, so check with your Faculty for specific book lists.
