Visa Application Guidelines for Non-EU/EEA Students at Griffith College 
 
Studying abroad is an exciting journey, but before you can pack your bags and begin your adventure at 
Griffith College, there’s one important step—getting your Irish study visa. 
 
If you’re from a non-EU/EEA country, you may need to apply for a visa before traveling to Ireland. To 
help you navigate the process smoothly, we’ve put together this step-by-step guide, covering 
everything from application forms to financial requirements. 
 
Do I need a Visa? 
Visas and Immigration matters are managed by the Irish Immigration Service – (ISD).You can check if you 
need a visa by visiting the Irish Immigration Service website: https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-
visit-ireland/visit-ireland-travel-path/  
 
ü If you need a visa to enter Ireland you apply online for the visa 
ü If you don’t need a visa to enter Ireland, you register with the Irish Immigration Service when you 
get to Ireland 
ü If you have an EU/EEA/Swiss/UK Passport, you don’t need to apply for a visa or register with 
Immigration 
 
When Should I Apply?

three months before their programme start date. Visa processing can take several months, and applying 
early ensures you have plenty of time to prepare for your move to Ireland.
