FOOD AND DRINK REGULATIONS  
Serving hot food  
Home made hot food may not be served at events.  College catering or an 
external caterer may be employed.  If an external caterer is employed, the 
following conditions must be adhered:  
 • 
The caterer must have HSE Food Hygiene Certification, which is to be 
      
approved by the College Catering Manager two weeks in advance of any 
event.  
 • 
The provider of the food and service must comply with the Hazard 
      
Analysis of Critical Control Points regulations of the food hygiene 
legislation.  
 • 
The food must be prepared and cooked off site.  Preparing food implies 
      
any form of preparation other than opening a packet.  
 • 
No naked flames (oil / candle food warmers) may be used to keep food 
      
hot.  An electrically powered unit is acceptable to keep food warm but 
may not be used to re- heat, reconstitute or cook at the service location.  
 • 
Microwaves and Toasters may only be permitted in designated kitchens 
      
with appropriate detection systems and may not be used on site.  
 • 
No steam is generated that is likely to set off the fire alarm.  
      
 • 
In the GMB, the Debating Chamber will not be used for eating, storing or 
      
preparing food.  
Where the following are sold/distributed/provided by Societies Clubs or an 
external caterer, the following will apply:  
Hot beverages Including Tea & coffee, Soups  
 
• 
Should be prepared off site and stored in Thermos Flasks as boiling 
   
     
       water is not necessary and kettles lead to difficulties relating to Health 
       and Safety.  
 
• 
No other sources of heating water may be used. 
   
     
Serving cold food  
•    Food should be refrigerated prior to service and sold/distributed within 
   90 minutes, or disposed. It is recommended that food is offered in 
   ‘batches’ should the service time required extend beyond 90 minutes.  
   No refrigeration should be used at the point of service.  
•    Foods should not contain mayonnaise unless consumed within 1 hour as 
   the risk of food poisoning increases as time passes.  
•   Hand contact with unwrapped food should be kept to a minimum and 
  appropriate hand wash facilities should be accessible.  
•   Pre-prepared dry snacks are permitted.  
•   Cake Sale: In the interest of fairness but without prejudice to the Junior 
  Dean’s authority, it shall normally be the case that only one cake sale per 
  term will be permitted to any individual University Society, Sports Club or 
  College Publication, or to the Students’ Union, or to the Graduate 
  Students’ Union.  
  
Alcohol  
 • 
Students attending the event should be provided with no more than 2 
      
free alcoholic drinks.  A ticketing or marking system should be in place to 
ensure that no individual student is provided with a greater number of 
free alcoholic drinks.  
 • 
Alcohol may not be ‘sold’ at events unless in the context of a licensed 
      
bar.  
 • 
No more than the approved number of students should be in attendance, 
      
this is the number indicated on the application form.  Given that number, 
an estimate of the drinks requirement should be made, and larger 
amounts of alcohol should not be brought to the venue.  
 • 
No 'cocktails' should be served, if alcohol is served it should be restricted 
      
to wine, beer or cider.  
 • 
No alcohol is to be served before 18.00.  
      
 • 
No alcohol may be consumed outside the venue.  
      
Disposal of rubbish  
 • 
External Caterers must remove all waste from the event location and 
      
College after the event.  
 • 
All glasses, cartons and bottles should be removed from the venue by 
      
the organisers.  
 • 
All waste should be disposed of in the appropriate recycling or general 
      
waste wheelie bins. See www.tcd.ie/greenpages  
 • 
The venue should be left in good condition after the event.  Should 
      
extraordinary cleaning be required, it will be a cost to the organisers and 
will be drawn from the booking deposit.  
Security  
 • 
If additional security is required for the event e.g. because of the 
      
presence of VIPs or the timing or the venue for the event, the organisers 
are liable for the cost.
