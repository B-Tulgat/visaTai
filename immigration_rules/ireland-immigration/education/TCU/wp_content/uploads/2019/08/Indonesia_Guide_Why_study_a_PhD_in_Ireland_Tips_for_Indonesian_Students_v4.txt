EDUCATION
SYSTEM
ABOUT IRELAND’S
Irish universities are autonomous and self-governing, and they offer 
degree programmes at the foundation, bachelor’s, master’s, and 
PhD levels. Irish Universities have dedicated international offices to 
help foreign students adjust to Irish academics and culture and to 
encourage their participation in campus clubs and societies.
Ireland is at the forefront of quality PhD education in Europe, with 
over 6,500 researchers currently undertaking PhD education in Ireland.
A PhD typically takes 4 years full-time to complete. PhD students 
are expected to make a substantial and original contribution to 
knowledge, normally leading to peer-reviewed publications. The 
examination for the degree of PhD is based on a description of the 
research written up as a thesis and defended in oral examination (“viva 
voce”). 
Over 80% of these PhD students are located in one of the seven Irish 
Universities Association (IUA) universities, who are committed quality 
provision through the National Framework for Doctoral Education and 
the IUA PhD Graduate Skills Statement.
Most PhDs in Ireland are “structured”. A Structured PhD enables 
students to achieve the best possible graduate research and training 
through several innovative measures designed to support students to 
achieve their academic and professional objectives.
