# How to get from Dublin Airport

## How to get from Dublin airport

We have simplified the Dublin Airport to city centre journey into a few short steps, with a number of public and private bus routes, as well as a steady supply of taxis, available. Clickhereto view a short video  on Dublin airport transport.

## Dublin Bus / 30-50 minutes / €1 - €3

Dublin Busis the  city’s public bus operator, operating across most suburbs and some regional  towns. The 16 and 41 routes run from Zone 15 outside Dublin Airport  Terminal 1 (refer to the airport’sbus  stop map).

The16 bustravels through the north Dublin suburb of Drumcondra  to O’Connell Street in the city centre and on to Dublin’s southern suburbs.  This route operates between 6am-11:30pm Monday to Saturday, and 8am-11:30pm on  Sundays and Irish public holidays.

The41 bustravels south through Drumcondra, finishing near O’Connell Street. This  route runs 24 hours each day of the week, including weekends.

Payment can be made in coins (exact fare) to the bus driver or  by purchasing pre-paid tickets using theTFI GO app.  Unfortunately, bank cards and digital payment methods are not currently  accepted. The standard one-way fare to the city centre from the airport is from €1.  Dublin Airport to city centre journey times vary depending on traffic conditions  but can take around 40 minutes.

Buses are low-floor accessible for wheelchair users via an  onboard ramp that can be deployed. These buses have a limited capacity for  luggage storage.

## Aircoach / 30-40 minutes / €7

Aircoachoperates  several bus routes into Dublin city centre and on to suburbs in south Dublin.  The Aircoach service has stops at Zone 2, Terminal 1 and Zone 20, Dublin  Airport Terminal 2. Please refer to the airportbus  stop mapfor more details.

The 700 bus route stops at city centre  locations, including O’Connell Street and Trinity, and suburbs including Donnybrook  and Stillorgan. 702 and 703 buses also go through the city, stopping at the 3  Arena and Grand Canal, and suburbs including Ballsbridge, Blackrock, and Dún Laoghaire,  and on to regional towns such as Bray and Greystones.The Aircoach service operates all year-round, except for  Christmas Day. The 700 route operates 24 hours a day, with buses departing  every 15 minutes at peak times. The 702 and 703 buses run between  3:30am-11:30pm. One-way fares differ depending on your stop, but a trip into  the city centre will cost around €7, with stops closer to the end of the routes  costing €15. Tickets can be purchased at the Aircoach departure points outside  the airport terminals or from the bus driver using a bank card, Apple / Google  Pay, or cash. However, we recommend pre-booking your ticket online. Journey  time will depend on traffic congestion, but it is usually 30 minutes to the  city centre and around one hour to destinations close to the end of the route.

## Dublin Express / 15-30 minutes / €8

Dublin  Expressoperates premium coaches between Dublin Airport and more than 15  stops in the city centre, including iconic spots such as Temple Bar, Trinity  College, and O’Connell Street, and transport hubs such as Heuston train  station. The Dublin Express buses run from Zone 1 outside Terminal 1 and Zone  21 outside Terminal 2 (check out Dublin Airport arrivalsbus  stop map), and each coach includes free customer Wi-Fi, USB charging points,  and an onboard toilet.Buses operate between 4am-12:30am, seven days a week. The  standard one-way fare to the city centre is €8. You can purchase tickets at  terminal bus stops using bank card or Apple / Google Pay (cash is not  accepted), but we recommend pre-booking your ticket online. The journey time  will depend on traffic conditions and other travel factors, but it is usually  30 minutes to the city centre.

## Taxi / 20-30 minutes / €20-€40

One of the simplest ways to make the Dublin Airport to city  centre journey is by taxi. To get a taxi from Dublin Airport, follow the signs  from inside Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 to the official Dublin taxi ranks outside  each building. A dispatcher is available at taxi ranks if you require any  assistance. All licensed taxis are obliged to display passenger rights and fare  calculations on the taxi meter in the front and back of the vehicle. Driver  identification cards must also be in clear view of passengers.While taxi fare rates vary depending on the day, time, route  taken, traffic congestion and other factors, here are a few approximate fares:

- Bus Áras central station, €15-€25

- Connolly train station, €20-€30

- O’Connell Street, €20-€30

- Trinity College, €25-€35

- Heuston train station, €30-€40

When you arrive at Dublin  Airport Terminal 1 or 2, you may notice that ride-share apps such as Uber,  Lyft, and Via don’t operate as normal. This is because taxi services are  heavily regulated in Ireland, so ride-sharing apps are used to book standard  taxis. These vehicles operate under the same fare structure as licensed Dublin  taxis found on the street. The appFreeNowis one of the  more commonly used apps, so we recommend downloading that if you want to  pre-book a taxi.
