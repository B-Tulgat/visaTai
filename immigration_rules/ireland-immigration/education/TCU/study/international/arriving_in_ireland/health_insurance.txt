# Health Insurance

In order to register with the Irish Immigration Service Delivery (ISD), as all non-EU/EEA/Swiss/UK students are required to do, you must show proof of health insurance to cover any major medical care necessary during your stay. Please check with your insurance company at home that you are sufficiently insured for your period of study in Ireland. If a student chooses to use a health insurance policy from their home country, please be aware that this will only be valid for the students first 12 months. It can be used for first registration with ISD, but not with subsequent registrations. Health insurance must be purchased from an Ireland based insurance provider after your first year of study.If students do not already have insurance cover, they may wish to insure with one of the health insurance providers in Ireland.

### Below are a list of Irish insurance companies to consider:

Irish Life Health:www.irishlifehealth.ie

Laya Healthcare:www.layahealthcare.ie

Study and Protect:www.studyandprotect.com
