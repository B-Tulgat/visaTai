Students who hold an EU/EEA/UK/Swiss passport do not require a visa to study and work in Ireland. If you are unsure about whether you are an EU/EAA national,see herefor a list of all EU/EAA countries. Some, but not all, non-EU/EEA students require an entry visa for Ireland.

To see if you require a visa for Ireland visithere.

Non-EU/EEA/UK/Swiss students who do not require a visa will still be required to register with the Irish Immigration Service Delivery after arrival. See the section below on "Immigration Registration with the IrishImmigration Service Delivery"for more information on how to register.

## Schengen Visa Information

Welcome to Trinity College Dublin’s Schengen Visa Information Advice Page. This page provides essential information and advice for students and staff planning to travel to Schengen Area countries.

What is a Schengen Visa?

A Schengen visa allows you to travel to any of the 29 European countries that are part of the Schengen Area. With this visa, you can stay for up to 90 days within a 180-day period, for tourism, business or family visits.

NOTE: Ireland is Not Part of the Schengen Zone

Ireland is not part of the Schengen Zone. This means that your Irish Residence Permit (IRP) does not entitle you to travel to the Schengen Zone if you are a visa-required national for the Schengen Zone. You must apply for a Schengen visa to visit these countries.

Schengen Area Countries

The Schengen Area includes the following countries:

Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.

Where do I apply for a Schengen visa?

You only need to make one visa application for your visit, even if you plan to travel to more than one country in the Schengen Area. There are rules about which country’s embassy you should make your visa application to:

> - If you are visiting one country in the Schengen Area, you should apply to the embassy of the country you plan to visit.- If you are visiting more than one country, you should make your application to the embassy of the country where you plan to spend the most time.- If you are spending the same amount of time in more than one country, you should apply to the embassy of the country where you are going first.

- If you are visiting one country in the Schengen Area, you should apply to the embassy of the country you plan to visit.

- If you are visiting more than one country, you should make your application to the embassy of the country where you plan to spend the most time.

- If you are spending the same amount of time in more than one country, you should apply to the embassy of the country where you are going first.

Types of Schengen Visas

Short-Stay Visa (Type C): For stays up to 90 days. It can be issued for single or multiple entries for as long as the visa is valid.

Airport transit Visa (Type A and B): For passing through the international transit area of an airport in the Schengen area during a stopover or a change of flights. It does not allow you to leave the international transit area.

Application Process

1. Gather Required Documents:

> - Completed application form- Valid passport (with at least two blank pages and valid for at least three months beyond the return date)- Recent passport-sized photos- Travel itinerary (flight and accommodation details)- Proof of registration- Proof of sufficient financial means- Travel insurance- Proof of purpose of visit (e.g., invitation letter, conference registration)- Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card valid for at least 3 months after your return date

5. Receive Your Visa: Once approved, ensure all details are correct.

Important Notice: Difficulty in Securing Appointments

Securing an appointment for a Schengen visa in Dublin has become very challenging. Due to high demand and limited appointment availability, we strongly recommend that students start looking for an appointment as early as possible.

We do not have the capacity to assist students with securing any appointments. Therefore, please plan ahead and aim to schedule your appointment at least 3 to 4 months prior to your intended travel date.

IRP Card Validation Requirement

Please note that your Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card must be valid for at least 3 months after your planned return date from the Schengen Area. Ensure your IRP card meets this requirement before applying for a Schengen visa.
