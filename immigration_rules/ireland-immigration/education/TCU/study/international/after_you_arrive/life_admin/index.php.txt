## Opening a Bank Account

When you arrive in Ireland, one of the first things to do is open your own bank account.You must open a bank account in person in a bank branch. You are advised to open an Irish bank account after you secure accommodation in Ireland. They may request to see your Trinity offer letter as proof of your circumstances.

### Mandatory Documents to Open an Account

- Photo ID (Passport or National ID card)

- Trinity ID card (If opening account prior to ID card collection, bank may accept Trinity  offer letter and proof of fees paid as evidence of student status)

- Proof of address: utility bill, Revenue/PPS letter, letter from Trinity Academic Registry sent to Irish address

Other documents may be requested depending on the bank and their policy on students' country of origin.There are normally no fees charged on student bank accounts. Ireland's most popular banks:

- AIB www.aib.ie

- Bank of Ireland www.bankofireland.com

After opening an account, you will be able to sign up for online banking and link to a home account. Please allow five working days for bank statement requests, whether made online or in a branch. If you will be under 18 at the time of opening your bank account, you will need a guardian to accompany you to open a bank account. For further information, please contact the Global Room at tcdglobalroom@tcd.ie. For postgraduates and visiting students securing private accommodation, most letting agents and landlords will accept cash or bank draft (which you can obtain with a foreign debit card or cash in an Irish bank) for the first month’s rent and security deposit as long as you set up direct debit from an Irish account as soon as possible after opening your new bank account.

## Getting a Mobile Phone or Sim Card

One of the first things you’ll want is a mobile phone, to get connected to the wider world, and also so you can phone home and let them know that you’re safe. This is one of the easiest things to do and earliest things you’ll want to get.

If you need to buy a new phone, there are plenty of phone shops in and around the city centre, primarily located on Grafton St. If you want to keep your old phone,but set up on an Irish network, it’s as simple as popping in, and talking to them about changing over your phone.

In Ireland, paying for phones comes under two categories: bill-pay and pre-pay. If you want to avail of a bill-paying phone, you’ll need a bank account first. You’ll also be asked to set up a fixed contract, which makes this a great option for Erasmus students who may only be here for a term. Pre-pay is even easier - it gives you ‘credit’, which you can then spend on texts and calls, and you can top-up from any shop or store once you run out. Pre-pay contracts often offer deals, like free calls on evenings and weekends, or free texts to phones on the same network.

The main network providers are:

- meteor.ie

- vodafone.ie

- three.ie

## Getting Your PPS Number
