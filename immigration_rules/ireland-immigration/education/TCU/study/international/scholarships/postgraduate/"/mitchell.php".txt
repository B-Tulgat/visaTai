# Mitchell Scholarship

The George J Mitchell Scholarship Programme was established by theUS-Ireland Alliance.

Up to twelve Mitchell Scholars between the ages of 18 and 30 are chosen annually for one year of postgraduate study in any discipline offered by institutions of higher learning in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Applicants are judged on three criteria:
scholarship,
leadership, and
a sustained commitment to community and public service.

The Mitchell Scholarship Program provides tuition, accommodation, a stipend for living expenses and travel.

Candidates for the Mitchell Scholarship Program must meet all the following criteria:

- Be U.S. citizens

- Be 18 years of age or older, but not yet 30, on the 30th September of the year of application (those who turn 30, on the 1st October are not eligible).

- Have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university before beginning study as a Mitchell Scholar. Degrees from international accredited universities are acceptable, if all other conditions are met.

- While married applicants or applicants with partners are accepted, no allowance is made for the expenses of an applicant’s spouse, partner, or dependents. It is important to note that the relevant government agency may require spouses or partners who are non-EU citizens to enroll full-time and prove financial resources for the year or to obtain a work permit before seeking paid employment in Ireland or Northern Ireland. Please check with the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland) or the British Council (UK) for details.
