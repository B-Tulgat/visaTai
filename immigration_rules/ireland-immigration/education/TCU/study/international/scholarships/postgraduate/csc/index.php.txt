## Timeline and important notes

- Candidates must hold a full offer for admission to a PhD at Trinity in order to apply for the scholarship.

- Academic supervisors apply for the scholarship on behalf of the student for the initial stage of the application. The deadline for applications is 14 February 2025.

- The academic panel reviews all applications and shortlists the pre-selected candidates in March.

- Shortlisted candidates apply to CSC directly for the second stage of the scholarship application between mid-March and early April on this website:http://apply.csc.edu.cn.

- Results are shared with academic supervisors in June.

## Application Process

### 1. Student applicants apply for a PhD

Applicants should contact a potential academic supervisor with a brief research proposal or idea. If the academic staff member is willing to support the application for a PhD position, they should support the applicant through Trinity’s application process.

### 2. Academic Supervisor / PI applies to Trinity for the CSC - Trinity College Dublin Joint Scholarship

Once applicants are in possession of an unconditional offer (conditional offers are accepted by CSC if they are based on academic requirement), the supervisor can apply for the scholarship on behalf of the students.

Please note that conditional offers based on English are not allowed by CSC. Students must fulfilTrinity's English Language Requirements

Applications should be sent by the Academic Supervisor to global.scholarships@tcd.ie. Applications should include the following documentation:

- Cover Sheet (provided in the appendix in the Guidelines for Schools document)

- Project proposal (max 2 pages)

- Brief biography of the supervisor (max 1 page)

- A statement linking the proposed research to the research strategy of the School in which the student will be registered (max 1 page).

At this stage, students should also contact their home institution's international office (or local Embassy in the event they are not in China) to advise of their intention to apply for the CSC Scholarship and follow any application procedures.

Students who have been shortlisted by Trinity will then be issued a letter that can be submitted for the CSC part of the application. Successfully shortlisted students will be notified by their supervisor mid-March.

### 3. Student applies directly to the CSC for the CSC - Trinity College Dublin Joint Scholarship

Between mid-March and early April student applicants must apply for the scholarship online to the CSChttp://apply.csc.edu.cn.. Students should check actual dates on the CSC website as they can vary each year.

The CSC will evaluate the candidates according to CSC requirements and priorities. Trinity Global will inform the supervisors of the outcome of the process in June.

### Eligibility

- Applicants must be citizens and permanent residents of the People’s Republic of China at the time of application (excluding Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan). Chinese students studying overseas may be eligible for application subject to the CSC policy at the time.

- Applicants must be enrolled in a full-time Master’s degree at a university in China. Bachelor’s degree students who are in their last year wishing to pursue master-doctor combined programme can also apply if they have an unconditional offer letter/letter of invitation combining master and doctoral study.

- For overseas Chinese students applying for full PhD study, only those who are in the last year of their master studies, recent graduates (less than one year), and those who are in the first year of their PhD studies are eligible to apply for joint scholarship program. Overseas Chinese students are required to be nominated by the Education Section of the Chinese Embassy in Ireland after they have completed their Trinity application.

- Those who work as an employee at a higher education institution, scientific research institution, or an administrative organisation or enterprise in China, and have earned a masters-level degree are eligible.

- Successful students must return to China upon completion of their studies or research.

- Applicants must hold an unconditional offer letter from Trinity College Dublin. They must therefore fulfil the relevant academic entry requirement set by Trinity, including a high level of English language proficiency. Conditional offer letters may be accepted in certain circumstances, but these offers may not be conditional on English language scores.

- Applicants should satisfy the selection criteria set out by the CSC. This policy is subject to change and is at the discretion of the CSC.
