## Trinity in the heart of Dublin

Trinity sits in the heart of Dublin’s city centre and over the centuries the city has grown around the university. Today, this is a great advantage for our students. Dublin is a vibrant, young, European capital city and everything the city has to offer is easily accessible to Trinity students. The vast array of restaurants, cafés, delis and coffee shops (most offering student deals and discounts) cater for every taste and budget.

## Why Ireland

## Be at the centre of things

Trinity’s central location makes it highly accessible for all forms of public transport: Trinity has its own LUAS (tram) station and there is a DART (Dublin’s suburban railsystem) station opposite the campus. A large number of Dublin’s bus services pass by the University and national bus routes are only a few minutes walk away. Dublin’s two main train stations are in close proximity, while Dublin airport is 13km (8 miles) from the campus and is directly accessible via bus or taxi. Find out morehere.

## Discovering Ireland

## Your university, Your city

Dublin’s theatres, museums, bars and clubs ensure that there is something exciting for students to enjoy every day of the year. There are plenty of places to shop, whether that’s for your weekly groceries or a browse through leading high street stores on Grafton or Henry Street. 
	    If you want to take time out to relax in	    nature, the city’s parks (including Phoenix Park, one of the largest urban parks in Europe), an easily accessible coastline, beaches and the Dublin Mountains are all close to hand.

## Your university your city

## Trinity's campus

Trinity’s campus contains state of the art, modern facilities including the Sports Centre, Nanoscience Research Centre, Long Room Hub, and the Biomedical Sciences Institute, all situated on a 47-acre campus of cobbled squares, historic buildings and green playing fields.

Trinity’s location is also advantageous when you are looking for a job. Dublin’s Innovation District, the ‘Silicon Docks’ is within walking distance, as is the International Financial Services Centre, and a large number of other businesses and organisations have their Irish headquarters close by. The Dublin region is also home to many global corporations across a range of sectors.
