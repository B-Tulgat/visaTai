Pranjal Bathla – India, Postgraduate: Mechanical Engineering

“It has been a great learning experience, both personally & professionally. With its diverse and multi-cultural environment, studying at Trinity gives a great opportunity to meet people from different nationalities and develop a new perspective. During my time here I have met so many people who have opened my mind to new experiences and possibilities. I was lucky enough to get an amazing chance to do a 1 month internship in Deloitte Ireland.”
