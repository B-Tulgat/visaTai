# Understanding Ireland:The Trinity Smart-Start Programme

TheTrinity Smart-Start Programmeis a week-long programme designed specifically for new international undergraduate students. The programme begins one week before Freshers’ Week and it provides the perfect introduction to the academic and social life of your new university and the country you will call home for the duration of your degree.

## What will I be studying?

If you are an international (non-EU) student embarking on an undergraduate career at Trinity College Dublin, then an exciting part of the journey that lies ahead is discovering a new country with a unique academic, cultural and social environment.Understanding Irelandimmerses you in the rich world of Irish history, art, literature and film. You will learn about Trinity College, the city of Dublin and Ireland’s unique cultural heritage.

At the core of this programme is a lecture series—College, City and Country—consisting of three interlinked multi-disciplinary strands. Students receive lectures in each of the three strands, as follows:

- Trinity and its Treasures:An exploration of Trinity’s history, its architecture and the treasures of the Old Library, especially the Book of Kells.

- Dublin through the Ages:An exploration of Dublin’s history from Viking town to modern city

- Ireland and the Irish:An exploration of what it means to be Irish as expressed in art, literature and film

## What is included?

In addition to its core lecture series—College, City and Country—the Smart-Start Programme includes a tour of Trinity’s historic city-centre campus, an introduction to our library services, and seminars that will give you a head-start in understanding how to get the most out of your Trinity education.

You will also go on field trips to sites of major cultural and historical importance both in Dublin and outside the city, such as the medieval monastic site at Glendalough.

## What our students say

‘Understanding Ireland was a wonderful way to begin my education at Trinity. Not only did I get a chance to learn about the unique history and culture of Ireland, but I was also able to talk to other students coming from similar backgrounds. The programme furthered my confidence in my decision to study at Trinity.’-Keelin Shaughnessy, 2014 first-year student from the US
