The IELTS exam is one of the most widely recognized language qualifications accepted by universities in English-speaking countries. Most institutions require a minimum IELTS score of 6.0 or 6.5. At IBAT, our IELTS Preparation Course is designed to help you achieve the necessary standards by developing your reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, as well as familiarizing you with the exam’s format and structure.

Both course paths include weekly progress tests aligned with the core textbook, supplemented by additional materials as needed. These assessments help track progress and identify areas for improvement.  There are also regularly scheduled exam practice sessions, followed by detailed, personalized feedback to enhance your skills and build confidence.

### Programme Focus

Our programmes focus on all four skills:

- Reading

- Writing

- Listening

- Speaking

The courses begin with a general introduction to the overall structure of the examination, followed by a gradual development of the sub-skills:

Reading

- Reading for detailed and specific information

- Deducing unknown vocabulary from context

- Justifying an answer

- Interpreting an author’s overall opinion of a given topic

Writing

- Exam task 1: Description of visual information – interpreting and comparing data in the form of graphs, bar charts, pie charts, tables, process diagrams, maps, cycles, e.g. water cycle, carbon cycle, etc.

- Exam task 2: Essay writing – structuring an argument while providing evidence, presenting and supporting points, comparing and contrasting, showing cause and effect, outlining advantages and disadvantages, and justifying an opinion.

- Text organisation (introduction and conclusion)

- General coherence – linking ideas and sentences appropriately

Listening

- Listening for gist and specific information – dates, times, prices, etc.

- Repeated exposure to exam-style recordings, e.g. monologues, two-way conversations, group discussions, lecture-style tutorials, etc.

- Emphasis is placed on the different native English-speaking accents

- Recording scripts are subsequently analysed for vocabulary content

Speaking

- Examination of academic vocabulary and expressions for recurring discussion topics

- Particular focus is placed on language accuracy and fluency

- Regular simulations of the complete speaking exam in student pairs

- Students will be carefully trained to complete each exam task in the specific allotted time and will practice transferring answers from exam booklets to the official exam answer sheet.

All our exam programmes are structured in a way that builds students’ confidence through continual practice of exam-specific tasks, combined with regular designated exam practice days followed by detailed feedback provided to each student.

Individual logs are kept of each student’s scores to highlight stronger skills and pinpoint weaker areas for further development. The aim of this is to show progression and to form the basis for assigning supplementary work to improve on these areas.

By the end of the IBAT Dublin IELTS preparation programme, you’ll receive:

- An internationally recognizedIELTS Certificate, valid for two years, accepted by employers and educational institutions worldwide as proof of your English proficiency
