### Course Overview

Our General English course is a semi-intensive programme that allows you to balance classroom tuition with structured study and free time activities. You will learn English and improve your language ability at a speed you feel comfortable with, while still having time to enjoy your surroundings.

This course is available at all levels, from Beginners to Proficiency, to ensure every student is placed in a class most suited to their level. The course focuses on the four main aspects of language: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. You’ll also learn vocabulary and grammar, and how to speak in formal and informal discussions and strategies.

- Beginners (Below A1 on the CEFR*)

- Elementary (A1 on the CEFR)

- Pre-intermediate (A2 on the CEFR)

- Intermediate (B1 on the CEFR)

- Upper-intermediate (B2 on the CEFR)

- Advanced (C1 on the CEFR)

- Proficient (C2 on the CEFR)

Whether you’re just starting out or looking for an advanced English course, our General English classes are offered at all levels in groups of a maximum of 15 students. Timetables are flexible so that students may study in the mornings or afternoons.

Our English language academic team decides the level of class upon a student’s completion of the entrance test on the first day of classes taken a week before the class starts.

IBAT offers English language tuition in our Frederick Street campus (24-27 North Frederick Street, Dublin 1). This campus is fitted with state-of-the-art learning facilities to enhance your English language journey with us.

### Tests and Examinations

Every week, students will be tested on what they have covered in class. These tests may be communicative or written and focus on all the skills.

Every 8 weeks, school-wide level tests are conducted to recognize student learning and ensure fair progression. These CEFR based tests cover all areas of language.

Note:All visa-required students must take the Test of Interactive English (TIE) at the end of their course of study. Other examinations (e.g. Cambridge exams – FCE and CAE) can also be arranged for students.

IBAT offers a range of TIE General English (GE) courses at all levels within a TIE exam format which focuses on three main communicative tasks:

- A short project on a subject of interest to the student

- A book of the student’s choice

- A news story from a newspaper and/or TV or radio.

Results are graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR):
