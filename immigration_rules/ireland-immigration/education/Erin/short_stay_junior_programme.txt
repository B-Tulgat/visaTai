Specific requests, such as breakfast or any other meal, can be customized to meet the needs of both students and teachers. The host family will be delighted to assist by providing guidance on public transportation options, helping students identify bus or train routes to Erin College, and even showing them around the neighborhood. Your host will be the primary point of contact to address any questions or issues during your stay.

All of the hosts come from different social demographics and backgrounds. Your group will all be staying in a variety of homes, with a broad mix of Irish and international hosts.
