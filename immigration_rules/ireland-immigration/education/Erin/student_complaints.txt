# Student Complaints Policy and Procedure

## Erin CollegeStudent Complaints Policy and Procedure

We hope you are happy here at Erin College, but you don’t have to suffer in silence. You can find details of student support at reception, or you can email us atinfo@erincollege.wp1.shforstudents from Dublinorinfo.cork@erincollege.wp1.shforCork students.

Once reception receives the email, they will forward it to the correct department to further resolve the issue. Students will receive a response to their query within 48 hours.

All complaints must be made in writing (email is acceptable) and made to reception via email. The complaint must include:

- The name of the individual, group or service about which you wish to complain

- All relevant details of your complaint

- The dates and times of the events

- Any witnesses

- Account of the circumstances of the complaint, including any previous actions taken to remedy it.

- Any other supporting evidence you wish to submit.

- Any suggestions you have for resolving the issue

Complaints should normally be madewithin 1-2 weeksof the event in question so that they can be dealt with as efficiently and quickly as possible.An investigation may need to take place and may include interviewing the complainant, the respondent, any witnesses named, and seeking any other relevant information necessary to determine an appropriate resolution.

It will be communicated to the student as to how the complaint has been or will be resolved, and it will then be issuedwithin 5 daysof the initial complaint. To appeal the decision, a letter/email must be sent to theHead of Academics within five (5) days.If this fails to resolve the issue, the issue may then be passed on toQQI.

The school is here to help and protect both students and staff and we will do our utmost to ensure that your time here is safe and happy.

False and/or maliciously motivated complaints will result in disciplinary action up to and including expulsion.

This document outlines the process followed in the event of the school receiving a complaint.
