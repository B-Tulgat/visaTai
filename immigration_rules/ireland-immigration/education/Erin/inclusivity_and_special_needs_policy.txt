# Inclusivity and Special Needs Policy

## Erin CollegeInclusivity and Special Needs Policy

- – The following is Erin College’sInclusivity and Special Needs Policy:

- – Erin College will incorporate students with special needs into the mainstream of our courses and will incorporate their strategies to assist their participation in our courses as much as possible.

- – Erin College staff are not experts in special needs education and are not equipped to devise strategies where they do not already exist.

- – Erin College staff have a responsibility to serve the needs of all their students equally, and therefore student strategies may be incorporated with an element of compromise.

- – Erin College students or partners will inform the school of students with special needs as soon as possible in the student journey to ensure they may be incorporated as smoothly as possible into the mainstream of our courses.
