## Mission, Vision and Values

Erin College aims to provide thehighest quality English tuition.

Provide the highest quality English tuition with a modern and efficient methodology, providing fluency and security for each student through immersion in Irish culture.

To provide high-quality of education while preparing students for the real world and inspiring students, professionals, and collaborators to reach their maximum potential.

Erin College exists to develop our students’ ability to communicate in English. To speak, listen, read and write, to understand in the world outside of the classroom. The desire to communicate and understand is the fundamental reason for all language study. Enabling students to do this requires English to be taught as a living, evolving subject, with meaning based on context and in the situations and for the purposes for which it is used. Our goal as a school is not for students to have learned a set of grammar items but to be able to express their thoughts in English as they do in their own language. This means that the learning objectives for all our courses are based on real world language use and mapped from the Common European Framework.
