- TIE

- IELTS

- Cambridge

## TIE is Ireland’s very own test of English accredited by ACELS

TIE exam is also on the ILEP list of accepted exams and it’s designed and administered by IELT. It consists of a speaking and a writing test with the intention to measure how well you can communicate in English. It is an exam that learners can take at any level.TIE (Test of Interactive English) is a multi-level exam based on three real-life tasks: reading a book, following a news story, and researching and preparing a presentation on a topic of the student’s choice. These tasks must be completed in advance before the exam day in order to be able to take it. The emphasis on pre-exam tasks allows even lower-level students to fully prepare and show their English skills at their best on the exam day.The exam itself consists of a writing and a speaking testThe nature of the exam tasks makes TIE a very realistic test of your English skills. It has a writing and a speaking test based on the book, news story, and research presentation prepared in advance of the test. There is no ‘grammar’ paper and listening is tested solely through the students’ ability to communicate during the speaking test.

The IELTS exam is a test of English ability. Perfect for anyone wishing to do further study or work in an English-speaking country. It is available in two formats: Academic and General. Students who want to study in an English-speaking university need to take the Academic test. Other applicants who need IELTS scores for a work visa or immigration purposes need to take the General IELTS test.

It is the most popular English test in the world. The test is accepted and trusted worldwide as a measure of English language ability. The practice for IELTS is a multi-level test but in reality it is best suited for levels intermediate and above. Students receive a certificate with their band score upon completion of the test. The certificate remains valid for two years.

## There are two versions of the exam

## General Training IELTS

General Training IELTS can be used for work and residential visas (depending on the individual requirements of the country in question). The exam consists of four tests: reading, writing, speaking, and listening.

Unlike the Cambridge main suite of exams, there is no ‘Use of English’ grammar/vocabulary-based test. Students’ command of English grammar and vocabulary is assessed solely through their use of it in communication. (please note that for UK Citizenship applications only IELTS for UKVI is accepted).

## Academic IELTS

Academic IELTS is now the standard test for university acceptance in English speaking institutions. The average score for university entrance is 6.5, although the score needed depends on the institution, so the grade needed could be higher or lower. There are four parts to the test: reading, writing, speaking and listening. The reading and writing tests are based on more academic material than the general training equivalents.We partner for the exam with University College Dublin. Please see below for the current available dates. Erin School of English includes exam preparation in your General English courses.

The Cambridge Main Suite exams are among the longest-running and most respected English language tests in the world. Unlike TIE and IELTS, the Cambridge exams are level specific with a tailored test for every level from A1 to C2. Cambridge Exam certificates have no expiry date.They are valid forever and are accepted by many universities, employers and government departments.
