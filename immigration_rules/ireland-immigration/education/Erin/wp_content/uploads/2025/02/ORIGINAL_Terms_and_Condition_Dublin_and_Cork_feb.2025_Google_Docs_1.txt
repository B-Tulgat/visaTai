‭1. Introduction and Overview‬
‭Welcome‬ ‭to‬ ‭Erin‬ ‭College!‬ ‭We‬ ‭are‬ ‭delighted‬ ‭that‬ ‭you‬ ‭have‬ ‭chosen‬ ‭Erin‬ ‭College‬ ‭in‬ ‭Dublin/Cork,‬ ‭Ireland,‬ ‭as‬ ‭your‬
‭destination‬‭for‬‭learning‬‭English.‬‭These‬‭terms‬‭and‬‭conditions‬‭outline‬‭the‬‭mutual‬‭responsibilities‬‭and‬‭expectations‬‭between‬
‭you,‬‭the‬‭student,‬‭and‬‭Erin‬‭College,‬‭the‬‭educational‬‭institution‬‭committed‬‭to‬‭providing‬‭a‬‭conducive‬‭and‬‭enriching‬‭learning‬
‭environment.‬
‭1.1. Purpose and Significance:‬
‭●‬
‭These‬ ‭terms‬ ‭and‬ ‭conditions‬ ‭are‬ ‭designed‬ ‭to‬‭ensure‬‭transparency,‬‭fairness,‬‭and‬‭clarity‬‭in‬‭our‬‭educational‬
‭relationship.‬ ‭They‬ ‭encompass‬ ‭various‬ ‭aspects‬ ‭of‬ ‭your‬ ‭academic‬ ‭journey,‬ ‭from‬ ‭enrollment‬ ‭to‬‭graduation,‬
‭covering essential policies and procedures.‬
‭1.2. Overview of Erin College's Educational Services:‬
‭●‬
‭Erin‬ ‭College‬ ‭is‬ ‭dedicated‬ ‭to‬ ‭delivering‬ ‭high-quality‬ ‭English‬ ‭language‬ ‭programs‬ ‭tailored‬ ‭to‬ ‭the‬ ‭needs‬ ‭of‬
‭international‬‭students.‬‭Our‬‭courses‬‭are‬‭designed‬‭to‬‭foster‬‭language‬‭proficiency,‬‭cultural‬‭understanding,‬‭and‬
‭personal development.‬
‭●‬
‭1.3. Erin College Mission, Vision, Values‬
‭Mission‬
‭Provide‬ ‭the‬ ‭highest‬ ‭quality‬ ‭English‬‭tuition‬‭with‬‭a‬‭modern‬‭and‬‭efficient‬‭methodology,‬‭providing‬‭fluency‬‭and‬
‭security for each student through immersion in Irish culture.‬
‭Vision‬
‭To‬ ‭provide‬ ‭high-quality‬ ‭education‬ ‭while‬ ‭preparing‬ ‭students‬ ‭for‬ ‭the‬ ‭real‬ ‭world‬ ‭and‬ ‭inspiring‬ ‭students,‬
‭professionals, and collaborators to reach their maximum potential.‬
‭Values‬
‭To‬ ‭be‬ ‭a‬ ‭respected‬ ‭and‬ ‭admired‬ ‭institution‬ ‭known‬ ‭for‬ ‭the‬ ‭quality‬ ‭of‬ ‭our‬ ‭teaching,‬ ‭innovation‬ ‭in‬ ‭learning‬
‭methodologies, and commitment to student satisfaction.‬
‭●‬
‭1.4. Erin College Educational Philosophy‬
‭Erin‬ ‭College‬ ‭exists‬ ‭to‬ ‭develop‬ ‭our‬ ‭students’‬‭ability‬‭to‬‭communicate‬‭in‬‭English.‬‭To‬‭speak,‬‭listen,‬‭read‬‭and‬
‭write,‬‭to‬‭understand‬‭in‬‭the‬‭world‬‭outside‬‭of‬‭the‬‭classroom.‬‭The‬‭desire‬‭to‬‭communicate‬‭and‬‭understand‬‭is‬‭the‬
‭fundamental‬‭reason‬‭for‬‭all‬‭language‬‭study.‬‭Enabling‬‭students‬‭to‬‭do‬‭this‬‭requires‬‭English‬‭to‬‭be‬‭taught‬‭as‬‭a‬
‭living,‬‭evolving‬‭subject,‬‭with‬‭meaning‬‭based‬‭on‬‭context‬‭and‬‭in‬‭the‬‭situations‬‭and‬‭for‬‭the‬‭purposes‬‭for‬‭which‬‭it‬
‭is used.‬
‭Our‬‭goal‬‭as‬‭a‬‭school‬‭is‬‭not‬‭for‬‭students‬‭to‬‭have‬‭learned‬‭a‬‭set‬‭of‬‭grammar‬‭items‬‭but‬‭to‬‭be‬‭able‬‭to‬‭express‬
‭their‬‭thoughts‬‭in‬‭English‬‭as‬‭they‬‭do‬‭in‬‭their‬‭own‬‭language.‬‭This‬‭means‬‭that‬‭the‬‭learning‬‭objectives‬‭for‬‭all‬‭our‬
‭courses are based on real world language use and mapped from the Common European Framework.‬
‭2. Enrollment and Admission‬
‭At‬‭Erin‬‭College,‬‭we‬‭strive‬‭to‬‭make‬‭the‬‭enrollment‬‭and‬‭admission‬‭process‬‭as‬‭seamless‬‭as‬‭possible,‬‭ensuring‬‭that‬‭you‬‭can‬

‭notarized‬ ‭permission‬ ‭from‬ ‭their‬ ‭parents.‬ ‭However,‬ ‭each‬ ‭program‬ ‭may‬ ‭have‬ ‭specific‬ ‭eligibility‬ ‭criteria,‬
‭including‬‭age‬‭restrictions‬‭and‬‭educational‬‭background‬‭prerequisites.‬‭It‬‭is‬‭essential‬‭to‬‭ensure‬‭that‬‭you‬‭meet‬‭all‬
‭eligibility criteria before applying to avoid any complications in the admission process.‬
‭2.3. Required Documents:‬

‭other‬ ‭documentation‬ ‭outlined‬ ‭in‬ ‭the‬‭admission‬‭guidelines.‬‭Timely‬‭submission‬‭of‬‭all‬‭required‬‭documents‬‭is‬
‭paramount for the efficient processing of your application.‬

‭statements‬‭from‬‭the‬‭Common‬‭European‬‭Framework‬‭of‬‭Languages‬‭(CEFR).‬‭There‬‭is‬‭exam‬‭preparation‬‭built‬
‭into the course programme to prepare students for their end-of-course exam.‬
‭●‬
‭The IELTS Preparation Course is also planned over a 14-week period, offering students sufficient time and‬
‭practice to clearly understand the format of the exam, and improve their skills in listening, reading, writing‬
‭and speaking.‬

‭topics tailored to students’ needs, including IELTS and exam preparation, job interview skills, CV writing,‬

‭Attendance‬‭at‬‭Erin‬‭College‬‭is‬‭crucial.‬‭For‬‭students‬‭holding‬‭a‬‭student‬‭visa,‬‭regular‬‭attendance‬‭is‬‭mandatory,‬‭aiming‬‭for‬‭a‬
‭record of at least 85%. Attendance records are final and cannot be changed after the course ends.‬
‭Being‬‭late‬‭or‬‭leaving‬‭early‬‭results‬‭in‬‭no‬‭attendance‬‭for‬‭the‬‭day,‬‭except‬‭for‬‭emergencies‬‭allowing‬‭up‬‭to‬‭14:59‬‭minutes‬‭of‬
‭lateness and 5:00 minutes of leaving earlier. Regular tardiness without valid reasons will affect attendance.‬
‭All‬ ‭students,‬ ‭including‬ ‭Europeans‬ ‭and‬ ‭those‬ ‭not‬ ‭on‬‭student‬‭visas,‬‭must‬‭attend‬‭regularly,‬‭as‬‭non-attendance‬‭disrupts‬
‭learning.‬
‭It‬‭is‬‭expected‬‭that‬‭you‬‭will‬‭participate‬‭in‬‭class‬‭activities,‬‭speak‬‭English‬‭and‬‭respect‬‭both‬‭teachers‬‭and‬‭classmates.‬‭Failure‬
‭to‬‭comply‬‭may‬‭result‬‭in‬‭attendance‬‭being‬‭removed‬‭for‬‭the‬‭day‬‭as‬‭well‬‭as‬‭expulsion.‬‭Tampering‬‭with‬‭attendance‬‭lists‬‭or‬
‭accepting bribes for falsifying attendance is strictly prohibited.‬
‭Any‬‭student‬‭not‬‭on‬‭the‬‭attendance‬‭list‬‭must‬‭report‬‭to‬‭Reception‬‭immediately.‬‭Adding‬‭names‬‭by‬‭hand‬‭to‬‭attendance‬‭lists‬
‭is not allowed. More detailed information is available in the Student Disciplinary Policy on our website.‬

‭make a request by email.‬
‭●‬
