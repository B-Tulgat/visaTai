## GENERAL ENGLISH

## GeneralEnglish

## Dublin and Cork

* To enroll in this course, a minimum age of 16 years is required.

We teach general English at every level – from Beginner (A1) to Advanced (C1). The course programmes for each level are 14 weeks long with built-in assessment designed to monitor your progress and indicate when you are ready to move to the next level. We carry out progress tests every 7 weeks where we check your level of English and your progress at that level.  This ensures that you are always in the right class for your development.

We operate an integrated syllabus which balances work on the four key skills of speaking, reading, writing and listening with contextualised language input including grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. Our English language lessons develop skills in recognisable and useful communicative contexts. Our teacher training programme is designed to emphasise the importance of placing all language in the context in which it is used. Thus, helping teachers to continuously improve their skills at doing so.
