# Student Disciplinary Policy

## Erin CollegeStudent Disciplinary Policy

Applicable to all students of Erin College

Erin College maintains a clear and concise disciplinary procedure to ensure that all students are treated fairly and equitably, fostering a safe and supportive learning environment. This framework provides essential guidance for school staff in handling disciplinary situations, promoting consistency and uniformity in responses to behavioral issues. By establishing transparent protocols, the college aims to uphold a culture of accountability while ensuring that students understand the expectations for their behavior, ultimately supporting their personal growth and academic success.

The following rules and procedures should ensure that:

– The correct procedure is used when inviting a student to a disciplinary hearing;

– Students are fully aware of the correct procedure, the standards of performance, action and behaviour required of you;

– Disciplinary action, where necessary, is taken speedily and in a fair, uniform and consistent manner;– On occasion it may be necessary for the company to conduct an investigation meeting to clarify a particular incident or occurrence prior to any potential disciplinary hearing. The purpose of this investigatory meeting is to establish the facts about a particular incident or occurrence, and the details of which will remain completely confidential. The investigation will be carried out by a designated member of the Management team or, if necessary, in the case of any possible conflict of interest, an agreed external third party. In either case, the person nominated will have appropriate training and experience and be familiar with the procedures involved. The designated investigator will meet with you and any witnesses or other relevant persons individually. The person investigating the complaints will make every effort to carry out and complete the investigation as quickly as possible. The investigation meeting itself should not be interpreted as a disciplinary hearing as no disciplinary sanction would ever be issued on foot of an investigatory meeting. Instead, the facts established in an investigatory meeting may be used to identify whether or not a formal disciplinary hearing ought to be conducted;

– On some occasions temporary suspension from the school or moving a student to a different class may be necessary in order that an uninterrupted investigation can take place. This should not be regarded as disciplinary action or a penalty of any kind;– Other than for an ‘off the record’ informal reprimand, students have the right to be accompanied by a student support agent or friend, who may act as a witness or speak on the student’s behalf, at any stage of the formal disciplinary process. However they are not there to answer questions on the student’s behalf. In addition, in line with the Code of Practice for Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures, there is no provision for legal representation at any stage of the disciplinary process. If the student’s chosen companion is unavailable at the time of the hearing the company should suggest a reasonable alternative time that is no more than five working days after the original time of the hearing. Should the chosen companion continue to be unavailable the Company may require the student to nominate an alternative representative and the hearing go ahead as scheduled.

– Students will not normally be expelled for a first breach of discipline, except in the case of Gross Misconduct or SOSG (Some Other Substantial Grounds);

– Students will only be disciplined after careful investigation of the facts and the opportunity to present their side of the case at a disciplinary hearing; and

– If a student is disciplined, that student will receive an explanation of the penalty imposed and will have the right to appeal against the finding and the penalty.

– The disciplinary procedure may be implemented at any stage if the student’s conduct or performance warrants such action.– The student will be invited via email to attend a formal disciplinary meeting at a reasonable place and time. At this meeting, the student will be able to state their case in response to the allegations against the student. The student will be given reasonabletime to prepare for the meeting. The student will be expected to take all reasonable steps to attend the meeting.– Where appropriate, information obtained during or relating to the disciplinary processwill be kept confidential.

It is not practicable to specify all the disciplinary rules or offenses which may result in disciplinaryaction, as they may vary depending on the nature of the situation. In addition to the specificexamples of misconduct and Gross Misconduct shown in this handbook, a breach of otherconditions, procedures, rules etc. within this handbook or supplementary handbooks or memoswill also result in the disciplinary procedure being used to deal with such matters.

The following are examples of Minor Misconduct. Please note that this is a non-exhaustive list:

– Failure to bring required materials to class: Not bringing a physical copy of the course book or other required materials.

– Disregarding teacher instructions: Refusing to follow the teacher’s instructions or refusing to participate in class activities.– Inappropriate use of cell phone: Consistently using a cell phone or other personal devices during class.

The following are examples of Major Misconduct. Please note that this is a non-exhaustive list:

– Disrespectful behavior: Being rude to other students or school staff, using insulting language, or engaging in objectionable behavior.– Unauthorized use of school facilities: Using school email, internet, or other resources inappropriately or without permission.– Non-compliance with instructions and policies: Failing to follow reasonable instructions from teachers or school staff or disregarding school rules and procedures.

– Inappropriate vocal expression: Raising one’s voice, shouting, or using inappropriate language in school.– Failure to report damage: Not reporting any damage to school property or premises immediately after it occurs.– Ignoring safety procedures: Failing to comply with standard safety protocols while on school grounds.

The following are examples of gross misconduct. If you are found to have engaged in any of the behaviors below, you will be subject to immediate dismissal from the school.

This list is not exhaustive:

– Indecent or immoral behavior: Actions that are grossly inappropriate or violate the moral standards of the school community.– Discrimination or harassment: Any deliberate acts of unlawful discrimination, serious harassment, or other serious breach of the school’s Terms and Conditions.– Violent or dangerous behavior: Fighting, physical assault, or any behavior that endangers the safety of others.– Theft: Stealing from the school, its staff, classmates, or other individuals (this includes taking or using school property, materials, or resources without authorization).– Fraud: Deliberate falsification of records, including attempts to alter attendance records, or any deliberate attempt to deceive or defraud the school, staff, or classmates.– Vandalism: Purposefully damaging, destroying, or sabotaging school property or the property of others on school premises.– Health and safety violations: Serious breaches of health and safety rules that endanger the lives or well-being of classmates, school staff, or any person on school property.– Misuse of school property or name: Interfering with or improperly using school facilities or the school’s name.– Inappropriate online activity: Deliberately accessing internet sites containing pornographic, offensive, or obscene material while on school property or using school devices.– Abuse of school policies: Misusing the school’s harassment or other protective policies.– Intoxicants on school grounds: Bringing intoxicating substances onto school property or attending classes while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The school maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward intoxicants.– Possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs: Bringing, using, or supplying illicit drugs on school property.– Serious negligence: Engaging in behaviours that cause harm, damage, or injury to others through negligence or carelessness.– Gross negligence or carelessness: Any behaviour or failure to follow school safety protocols that jeopardizes the health and safety of classmates, staff, or the general public.

a)We reserve the right at our discretion for the authority to bypass any step in the disciplinary process if we feel that the severity of the action warrants it. We will be fair in the application of such discretion.b)It is not always necessary to use the formal disciplinary procedure if problems are dealt with early. Minor issues can be dealt with by counselling in the first instance, followed by an informal warning.c)In cases of gross misconduct, the earlier stages of the procedure will not apply. If gross misconduct is found to have taken place, this will result in immediate expulsion

In the event of a warning, it will generally apply as follows: an oral or first written warning will remain active for eight months.

At any stage in the disciplinary procedure and in particular where gross misconduct is alleged, the school reserves the right to expel the student prior to the disciplinary meeting being held and a decision being reached. If the student is expelled the student will not be entitled to access any of the school’s premises except at the prior request or with the prior consent of the school and subject to such conditions as the school may impose.

a)The disciplinary rules and procedure which form part of the student’s contractincorporate the right to lodge an appeal in respect of expulsion except when theexpulsion was due to misconduct of behavior

b)The student must send an email to info@erincollege.wp1.sh (Dublin) orinfo.cork@erincollege.wp1.sh (Cork) stating that they wish to appeal the expulsion

c)An expulsion appeal meeting is scheduled and conducted with one of the directors

d)An investigation is conducted into the circumstances of the expulsion

e)The directors make a final decision on the expulsion, if there are grounds to overturn it or not and inform the student via email of this final decision within 5 business days

All students are responsible for keeping within the guidelines.

Any student found to be in breach of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action.
