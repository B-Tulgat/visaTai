## What is a Personal Public Service (PPS) number?

Your Personal Public Service (PPS) number is a unique reference number that helps you access social welfare benefits, public services and information in Ireland.

A PPS Number is always 7 numbers followed by either one or 2 letters. It is sometimes called a PPSN.

You have a PPS number if:

- You were born in Ireland in or after 1971

- You started work in Ireland after 1979

- You are getting a social welfare payment

- You are taking part in theDrugs Payment Scheme

## Where can I find my PPS number?

PPS numbers are printed on the following documents:

- Public Services Card

- Tax Assessment

- PAYE Notice of Tax Credits

- Temporary Payment Card

If you do not know your PPS number, contact yourIntreo Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Officeand staff there can find your number for you.

### I have the same PPS number as my husband

If your PPS number is the same as your husband’s PPS number, but the last letter is W, you must get a new PPS number in the following circumstances:

- Your spouse is deceased

- You are divorced or separated

- You were issued with a Social Insurance number before 1979

You can contact Client Identity Services in the Department of Social Protection (see contact details below) for help. Read more about thephasing out of W Numberson Gov.ie.

## Using my PPS number

You need your PPS number to use certain public services. Onlycertain services are allowed to ask for your PPS number.

For example, if you are starting work, you need a PPS number to register with the Revenue Commissioners. However, when you are looking for work, employers should not ask for your PPS number when recruiting. An employer should only ask for your PPS number when you are actually taking up employment with the company.

You will need your PPS number for:

- All social welfare services

- TheFree Travel Pass

- Registering for a course in a school or college

- Public health services, including themedical cardand theDrugs Payment Scheme

- Child immunisation

- Schemes run by the Revenue Commissioners, such asmortgage interest relief

- Housing grants

- Driver theory testinganddriving licences

If you are unsure whether a particular organisation, person or agent is allowed to ask for (or use) your PPS number, contact Client Identity Services in the Department of Social Protection (see contact details below).

## Rules for getting a PPS number

A person who is under 18 years of age is considered a child for PPS number applications.

Children born in Ireland are given a PPS number if their birth is registered with the General Register Office (GRO) within 3 months of their birth. In this case, you do not need to apply for your child’s PPS number.

You must apply for a child’s PPS number if:

- The child’s birth is not registered within 180 days

- The child is born in Ireland and both parents’ addresses are outside Ireland
