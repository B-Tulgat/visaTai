IntroductionIf you are allowed to enter the stateRegistration officeIf you are refused permission to enter the state

## Introduction

When you arrive in Ireland you must show your passport, permit, visa and all otherrequired documentationto the immigration officer at the airport or other port of entry.

The immigration officer will then decide if you are allowed to enter the country.

Even if you have a valid visa for Ireland, you could be refused entry by the immigration officer if they are not satisfied with your documents or explanations.

## If you are allowed to enter the state

The officer will place a ‘landing stamp’ in your passport to give you temporary immigration permission to stay here. This stamp identifies how long you can stay.

The maximum time you can stay will be shown by a date on the landing stamp. The usual time limit is 3 months, though you may be given less.

If you arrive with a short stay ‘C’ visa, you must leave the country before your landing stamp expires.

## Registration office

If you arrive with a long stay ‘D’ visa and wish to stay longer than 3 months, youmustvisit theDublin Registration Office in Burgh Quaybefore your landing stamp expires to extend your immigration permission and register your details.

## If you are refused permission to enter the state

If you are refused permission to enter the state, you will be returned to where you left from.
