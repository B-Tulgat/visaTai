### Alternative Evidence of Finance – Degree Programme Students Only

A pilot programme is in operation that allows degree programme students only, to provide an alternative to bank statements as a method of proof of finances. The alternative method is an education bond with a minimum value of €10,000. The bond must be lodged to an approved student fees payment service for example – the electronic fee payment service offered by Transfermate (formerly Pay to Study –https://educationbondireland.transfermateeducation.com).

The bond must be held continuously from the initial visa application through to the time you register in Ireland with the immigration authorities. This is to ensure that the necessary funds exist and are reserved for your personal use. The bond will be cashable when you arrive in Ireland or if for any reason the visa is refused or you decide not to take up your place in the college.

A receipt showing that you have paid for a bond will generally be accepted by the Visa Officer as evidence of finances. However, you should be aware that you may also be asked to provide additional evidence of finances if that is considered necessary. Upon your arrival in the State, the funds will be released to you.

Students who participate in a bond payment scheme should note that this is a contractual arrangement between you and the bond service provider. Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) is not a party to any contract entered into between a student and a bond service provider.

## Types of courses and Colleges eligible for participation in the Student Bond System

Students who are enrolled on the type of courses listed below are not obliged to participate in a bond payment system, and may prefer to provide the normal evidence of finances as set out above.
