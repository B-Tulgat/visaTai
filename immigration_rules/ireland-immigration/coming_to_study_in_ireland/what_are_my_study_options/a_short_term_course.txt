- A short term course

## In This Section

IntroductionBefore you apply for your visaWhen you travel

## Introduction

If you want to do a short term study course (for example – less than 90 days to learn the English or Irish language, or for cultural studies) in Ireland and are from a visa required country you will be regarded as a visitor and have to apply for a Short Stay visa (also called C Visa).

## Before you apply for your visa

All students have to enrol and pay for their course of study (in full) before travelling to Ireland. If you are visa required, you mustapply for a Short Stay Visit (Tourist) visato study in Ireland. You will not be allowed to come to Ireland without a visa.

## When you travel

Prepare for border control. You will need to prove that you have a valid reason for entering Ireland (for example, study) to an immigration officer at border control. To do so you will need your passport, visa (if required) and several other documents. If you cannot satisfy the immigration officer of your reasons for travelling, you will not be allowed to travel into Ireland.
