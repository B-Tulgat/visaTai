## TrustEd Ireland, QQI’s international education mark

The ILEP will be superseded by theTrustEd Ireland statutory quality markfor student immigration purposes. All education providers intending to recruit non-EEA students must gain authorisation fromQuality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)to use theTrustEd Irelandstatutory quality mark.

The new mark will be awarded to higher education and English language education providers who have demonstrated that they meet national standards to ensure a quality experience for international learners from pre-enrolment through to the completion of their programme of education.

Once the ILEP is discontinued, only education providers granted authorisation to use the TrustEd Ireland mark will be eligible to recruit students from outside the EEA to English language programmes, foundation programmes and higher education programmes.

The final ILEP update will be published in June 2025. Where a provider has programmes listed in the ILEP and remains in compliance with ILEP criteria, it may continue to recruit non-EEA nationals until the ILEP ceases operation.

Providers with programmes listed in the ILEP are strongly advised to apply for theTrustEd Irelandmark. Further information about TrustEd Ireland, the application process and timeframes are set out onTrustEd Ireland information pageon the QQI website. Any questions regarding TrustEd Ireland should be addressed to the International Education Division of QQI atinternational.education@qqi.ie

Any providers planning to recruit non-EEA nationals to programmes must apply to QQI for authorisation to use the TrustEd Ireland quality mark.

## Ongoing monitoring of providers

Providers must comply with immigration regulations and ILEP criteria and requirements. Immigration Service Delivery may carry out unannounced inspections, spot checks and monitoring of activity and compliance.

Providers must inform the ILEP unit (within five working days) of any change to status. This includes, for example, any changes to staffing, location of provision, learner protection arrangements, ownership or governance. Failure to notify us, or the provision of false or misleading information, may result in the removal from the ILEP of all the provider’s programmes.
