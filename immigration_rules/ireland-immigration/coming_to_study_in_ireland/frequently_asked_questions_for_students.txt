- Frequently asked questions for students

Important information for non-EEA national student immigration permission – September 2023

## What courses or programmes can a non-EEA national study in Ireland?

If you are a non-EEA national coming to study in Ireland you must be enrolled in a full-time course or programme on theInterim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP).

In order to be granted student permission in Ireland, you must enrol on a full-time day time programme. Part-time or distance learning courses do not qualify for student permission.

## How can I check that the programme I want to study is included on the ILEP?

Check theILEPto find out if the programme is listed. Student permission will only be granted if you have enrolled on and started a programme listed on the ILEP.

## What programmes are available on the ILEP?

TheILEPincludes the following types of programmes or courses:

- English language programmes

- Higher education programmes

- Professional awards

- Foundation programmes

Students are advised to research the provider and programme before enrolling. The ILEP does not guarantee the quality of the provider, however, providers listed on the ILEP must meet certain criteria and standards. Providers must have learner protection for enrolled non-EEA students and cannot accept fees in cash. Before making any purchase, students should assess what is on offer, the reputation of the institution and its facilities and be aware the lowest price may not necessarily be the best deal. A provider must list all costs in advance, including exam fees.

## Can I change from one degree to another after I start the programme?

If you come to Ireland to study a degree, you will be granted an immigration permission for a specific programme offered at an approved higher education provider. Only in very exceptional circumstances will you be allowed to change programme during the first year of your studies.

You must provide an academic report from the provider, including detailed exam results. You will also have to provide an enrolment letter for the new degree programme you wish to undertake that outlines why the new provider believes you are suitable to enrol in this course, taking into consideration you have not completed your original programme.

Students may not transfer from a degree to a language programme. Students may not change from a Masters programme to a degree course.

## If I fail my exams, can I extend my stay in Ireland to repeat them?

If you have been unable to sit exams because of circumstances beyond your control, such as accident or illness supported by medical evidence, you may be able to extend your permission for four months to allow you to take the exams.

If you can demonstrate that your exams results were sufficiently close to the pass mark or you passed most of your other modules we will also consider your case.

We won’t extend permission to retake a full year’s tuition.

## What happens if my course is removed from the ILEP?

If you are studying a programme that is removed from the ILEP, you will be allowed to complete it as long as you comply with the conditions of your immigration permission.

## Do I need a visa?

Students from some countries need a valid visa to come to Ireland.Find out if you need a visa.

## What immigration permission can I get as a student on a full-time English language programme?

## How long can a student stay in Ireland studying English language full-time?

A student may be granted immigration permission for a maximum of three English language programmes of 8 months duration each. The total duration of immigration permission for a new student attending English language programmes is two years (i.e. three x 8 months). You will need to provide your end-of-programme exam results and meet attendance requirements in order to renew your permission each time. If you wish to stay on as a student after that time you must enrol on a higher education programme listed on the ILEP.

All colleges must provide learner protection for students. This protects you if your programme ceases prematurely. This could mean you complete the programme with another provider, or you are given a refund of a portion of your fees. Your letter of acceptance from the provider must clearly state that you are covered by learner protection arrangements. If the learner protection arrangements are through an insurance scheme, the provider must give you a certificate of proof in your name demonstrating that you are covered. This certificate shows you what to do if you need to make a claim.

Providers must also publish the names of the recruitment agents they deal with. Before making a decision, you should assess what is on offer, the reputation of the institution and its facilities. The lowest price may not be the best deal. A provider must list all costs in advance, including exam fees and cannot accept fees in cash. You should research the provider and programme before enrolling or transferring any money to a provider or an agent.

## What are the holiday arrangements for full-time non-EEA students on English language programmes?

The college must have all of its course timetables available on the college website and timetables will include holiday arrangements. Providers must publish the holidays policy on the website.

You cannot take holidays before starting your programme and holidays cannot exceed one third of the total weeks you have studied. When you enrol in a programme, the college will give you a written timetable that outlines your holiday arrangements. You must show this to the Immigration Officer when registering your immigration permission.

## Do I sit an exam when studying a full-time English Language programme?

## Can I pay my programme fees in cash?

No, colleges cannot ask for cash payment. You must pay programme fees through an approved money transfer facility or by electronic bank transfer.

## Can a provider ask me for extra fees that I did not know about before I enrolled on the programme, e.g. exam fees?

## Can I get a refund?

All providers must publish their refund policy on their website. You should check the refund policy before you enrol on a programme. The refund policy must set out the maximum time it will take to receive a refund, which cannot be longer than two months. Any administrative charges or portion of fees retained by the provider must be advised to you before you pay or enrol. The policy must list conditions where you may not be eligible for a refund.

If your visa application is refused or you are refused entry into Ireland, your refund request must be processed within 20 working days. The refund policy will describe how to request a refund.

## Can I study a part time programme?

No, you must enrol on a full time programme listed on the ILEP.

## Can I work while studying?

Yes, you can work up to 20 hours per week during term time. During June, July, August and September, and between 15 December and 15 January, you can work up to 40 hours per week.

## Can I bring family members with me?

No, students are typically not permitted to bring family members with them. There are some very exceptional circumstances where this may be permitted.

## Do I need to register my permission to be in the State?

Yes, all non-EEA students, including those who do not require a visa must register, for the first time, to remain in Ireland for more than 90 days.You must make a first time registration appointment in advance via the Customer Portal  to attend the public Registration Office in Burgh Quay, Dublin.

## Is there a registration fee?

Yes, the registration fee is €300.

## What is the total period of time a non-EEA student can be permitted to study in Ireland?

You can stay up to seven years as a student. If you have studied before in Ireland it will count towards your total time as a student.

## Do I need to have enough money to support myself?

Yes, you need to show us that you have enough money to pay your programme fees and all other living expenses while you are in Ireland.

If you need a visa to come to Ireland, you will be asked to show proof of your financial resources by the visa authorities. Details of these requirements can be found at the following link:Information on Student Finances

If you don’t need a visa to travel to Ireland, you will be asked to show proof of your financial resources at time of registration. Details of these requirements can be found at the following link:Requirements and documents needed

You could also provide a valid credit or debit card with that amount of money available in the account.

If you are a scholarship student and your college is covering your costs, we will ask for a letter stating that.

If students have any further questions in relation to the cost of living as a student in Ireland, we would encourage them to liaise directly with their college/university who will be able to advise them as appropriate.

### Important information for non-EEA national student immigration permission – September 2023

The policy and guidelines for immigration permission for non-EEA national students are set out in detail on this website.

- https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/frequently-asked-questions-for-students/

- https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/

- https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-study-options/a-third-level-course-or-a-language-course/

These guidelines and policies have been updated over the years and the current up to date position for non EEA national students is available on our website. The website sets out what we refer to as The Student Pathway.

The Student Pathway is as follows:

1. The non-EEA national student takes up an English language course or higher education programme that is listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP). The non-EEA national student is registered on Stamp 2 student conditions and has concession to work 20 hours per week (without an employment permit) during term-time and 40 hours per week during vacation time.  Vacation times June, July, August and September, and between 15 December and 15 January.

2. The maximum time a person can do English language courses is two years. This consists of three courses of eight months each. English language students are then required to undertake a higher education programme listed on the ILEP to qualify for further immigration permission as a non-EEA national student.

3. The Third Level Graduate Programme allows graduates with a level eight (8) qualification (awarded in Ireland) to get a 12-month extension to their residence permission on Stamp 1G, provided the number of years spend on the student pathway (stamps 2,2A, 1A, 1G) do not exceed seven (7) years in total. Graduates with qualifications at level nine (9) or above may get a 24-month extension (two blocks of 12-months) to their permission provided the number of years spent on the student pathway (stamps 2, 2A, 1A, 1G) does not exceed 8 years in total.

4. The Third Level Graduate Programme gives a permission on Stamp 1G. This is for the purpose of seeking graduate level employment and applying for a general employment permit, a critical skills employment permit or research hosting agreement. This time is given to allow graduates to work 40 hours a week without an employment permit and seek an employment permit based job.

5. When graduates get an Employment Permit issued by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment they can then register on Stamp 1 conditions. If a graduate does not get an employment permit, or does not apply for and qualify for another immigration permission, before the end of their Stamp 1G student permission they will be expected to leave the State.

The Domestic Residence and Permission Division (DRP) has recently been receiving a high level of applications and queries regarding conditions for Non-EEA national students.

Non-EEA national students should be aware of the following conditions attached to their immigration permission.

- English language students are required to attend at least 85% of their classes. They are also required to sit a recognised exam at the end of the programme. This is a requirement of the stamp 2 immigration permission. English language students must show proof of this exam to qualify for further immigration permission. If an English language student does not achieve this attendance level or sit the exam they may be refused further immigration permission.

- Degree level students are required to demonstrate progression in their studies in order to qualify for further immigration permission.

- English language students can attend a maximum of three (3) English language courses lasting at least 25 weeks each with permission of up to eight (8) months for each. This adds up to two (2) years in total. At the end of two (2) years the student is required to progress onto a higher education programme in order to qualify for further immigration permission as a non-EEA national student.

- The first port of call for any non-EEA national student who has difficulties or queries is their local immigration office.

- When a graduate is on a Stamp 1G it is expected that they, or their employer, will apply for and obtain an employment permit before the end of the permission. It is not generally permissible to extend immigration permission in order to facilitate a late application for an employment permit.

- If a non-EEA national student is refused registration at their local immigration office and they believe there are exceptional circumstances in their case it is then open to them to make anapplicationto DRP.

Over the course of the past three years certain concessions have been afforded to non-EEA national students in the State. During the pandemic, the Minister extended all immigration permissions nine times to allow people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 to be legally permitted to remain here until 31 May 2022. These extensions were made in the context of an uncertain health and international travel situation to provide assistance and assurance to people who use the immigration services.

In addition during the pandemic and in recognition of the difficulties graduates faced in accessing employment opportunities DRP extended Graduate permissions (Stamp 1G) for many graduates on request. It should be noted that, while some degree of flexibility was exercised for immigration registrations and renewals during the Covid19 pandemic, the policies and guidelines regarding the issuing of Immigration Permissions to Non-EEA National Students did not change and will continue to be applied in all circumstances.
