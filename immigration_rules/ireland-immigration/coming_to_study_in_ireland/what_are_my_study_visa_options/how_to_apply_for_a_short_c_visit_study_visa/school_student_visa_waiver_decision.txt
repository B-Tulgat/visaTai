# School Student Visa Waiver Decision

- Coming to study in Ireland

- What are my study visa options?

- How to apply for a short ‘C’ visit (study) visa

- School Student Visa Waiver Decision

## Non EU/EEA school student resident in EU/EEA Member State

If you are a non-EU or EEA school student who is resident in an EU or EEA Member State and wish to travel to another EU or EEA Member State as part of a group school excursion, you may be exempt from the requirement to be in possession of a visa.

This exemption arises from the implementation of theEuropean Council Decision (94/795/JHA)on a joint action adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3(2)(b) of the Treaty on European Union concerning travel facilities for school pupils from Non-EU Member Countries resident in a Member State. Please note that an upper age limit does not apply, provided the pupil is part of a school group.

If the school is based outside of Ireland and is travelling to Ireland: Please contact your National Immigration Authority to authorise your trip before travelling to Ireland. This authorisation can then be presented to the Irish Immigration Officer on arrival to the Irish State.Any queries should be directed to the Immigration Authority in the country of residence. The Irish Immigration Service cannot assist with such queries.
