## Non EU/EEA school student resident in EU/EEA Member State

If you are a non-EU or EEA school student who is resident in an EU or EEA Member State and wish to travel toanother EU or EEA Member Stateas part of a group school excursion, you may be exempt from the requirement to be in possession of a visa.

This exemption arises from the implementation of theEuropean Council Decision (94/795/JHA)on a joint action adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3(2)(b) of the Treaty on European Union concerning travel facilities for school pupils from Non-EU Member Countries resident in a Member State. Please note that an upper age limit does not apply, provided the pupil is part of a school group.

If the school is based outside of Ireland and is travelling to Ireland: Please contact your National Immigration Authority to authorise your trip before travelling to Ireland. This authorisation can then be presented to the Irish Immigration Officer on arrival to the Irish State.Any queries should be directed to the Immigration Authority in the country of residence. The Irish Immigration Service cannot assist with such queries.

Schools based in the Irish StateIn order to avail of this exemption, the head of your school must complete an application form (in editable PDF format). This application form must be sent by email from an official email address of the school tofirsttimeregistrations@justice.ieThe completed Visa Waiver form must be forwarded to the FTR inbox in the form of a scanned pdf.
