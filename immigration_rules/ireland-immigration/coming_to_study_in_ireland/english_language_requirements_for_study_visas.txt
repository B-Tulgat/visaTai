- English language requirements for study visas

## In This Section

IntroductionCurrent Minimum English Language Standards

## Introduction

The minimum standards on this page are for visa purposes. The minimum English language standard for your course, as set down by the college concerned, may be different.

English language course applicants are not required to provide evidence from a test provider when submitting their application.  However, you may be asked by the Visa Officer to provide alternative evidence of a basic level of English before coming to Ireland.

The certificate of your English language standard must have been issued within 2 years of the expected start date of your course.

In addition, to address problems being experienced accessing supervised tests because of Covid-19, we will also accept the results of online tests from the Test Providers.

## Current minimum English language standards

- First Certificate in English

- Cambridge English: Advanced

- Cambridge English: Proficiency

- Business English Certificate (Higher or Vantage)

The table above refers to language requirements for immigration purposes only. The onus is also on each student to ensure that they meet the language requirements of their intended college/educational institution.

* 2nd level education courses may only be undertaken in a private, fee-paying school or college.

** Foundation level refers to Level 5 courses on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).

*** If you need to complete a preparatory English course before you start the main course (for example, you want to do a degree course and your English language needs to be improved before you can do the degree course) then the following additional rules apply.

- The preparatory English coursemust not exceed 6 monthsin duration

- You must submit a detailedstudy planwith your visa application, including:(a) the duration and dates of your preparatory English course; and(b) details and dates of your main course of study.

- Fees must be paid in fullto the college(s) for both the preparatory English course and the first year of your main course. Evidence of the payments must accompany your visa application.
